Hi Matt, actually we got stuck on reordering the topics and have updated our
list. I am having a hard time visualizing the flow and think it would help for
us to walk through it. And I was thinking about whether consuming news is the
same as a tool, and I don't think it really is. But I was hoping others would
chime in.

do you want to setup a meeting tomorrow to facilitate this conversation? or you
do you think you can do it via email. I only ask because if we do meetings every

around to help you visualize this

t even had enough time with MaryAnne. Some things that are clear to her are
still muddled in my brain. Yes. I'll do that. I guess I can schedule a time and
let everyone know even if all can't make it. I'll schedule something for
tomorrow a.m.
