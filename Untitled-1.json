Abbreviation List......e140\n\nPreamble\n\nThe medical profession should play a central role in evaluating the evidence related to drugs, devices, and procedures for the detection, management, and prevention of disease. When properly applied, expert analysis of available data on the benefits and risks of these therapies and procedures can improve the quality of care, optimize patient outcomes, and favorably affect costs by focusing resources on the most effective strategies. An organized and directed approach to a thorough review of evidence has resulted in the production of clinical practice guidelines that assist physicians in selecting the best management strategy for an individual patient. Moreover, clinical practice guidelines can provide a foundation for other applications, such as performance measures, appropriate use criteria, and both quality improvement and clinical decision support tools.\n\nThe American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have jointly produced guidelines in the area of cardiovascular disease since 1980. The ACCF/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Task Force), charged with developing, updating, and revising practice guidelines for cardiovascular diseases and procedures, directs and oversees this effort. Writing committees are charged with regularly reviewing and evaluating all available evidence to develop balanced, patient-centric recommendations for clinical practice.\n\nExperts in the subject under consideration are selected by the ACCF and AHA to examine subject-specific data and write guidelines in partnership with representatives from other medical organizations and specialty groups. Writing committees are asked to perform a formal literature review; weigh the strength of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and include estimates of expected outcomes where such data exist. Patient-specific modifiers, comorbidities, and issues of patient preference that may influence the choice of tests or therapies are considered. When available, information from studies on cost is considered, but data on efficacy and outcomes constitute the primary basis for the recommendations contained herein.\n\nIn analyzing the data and developing recommendations and supporting text, the writing committee uses evidence-based methodologies developed by the Task Force (1). The Class of Recommendation (COR) is an estimate of the size of the treatment effect considering risks versus benefits in addition to evidence and/or agreement that a given treatment or procedure is or is not useful/effective or in some situations may cause harm. The Level of Evidence (LOE) is an estimate of the certainty or precision of the treatment effect. The writing committee reviews and ranks evidence supporting each recommendation with the weight of evidence ranked as LOE A, B, or C according to specific definitions that are included in Table 1. Studies are identified as observational, retrospective, prospective, or randomized where appropriate. For certain conditions for which inadequate data are available, recommendations are based on expert consensus and clinical experience and are ranked as LOE C. When recommendations at LOE C are supported by historical clinical data, appropriate references (including clinical reviews) are cited if available. For issues for which sparse data are available, a survey of current practice among the members of the writing committee is the basis for LOE C recommendations and no references are cited. The schema for COR and LOE is summarized in Table 1, which also provides suggested phrases for writing recommendations within each COR.\n\nTable 1Applying Classification of Recommendation and Level of Evidence\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nA new addition to this methodology is separation of the Class III recommendations to delineate whether the recommendation is determined to be of “no benefit” or is associated with “harm” to the patient. In addition, in view of the increasing number of comparative effectiveness studies, comparator verbs and suggested phrases for writing recommendations for the comparative effectiveness of one treatment or strategy versus another are included for COR I and IIa, LOE A or B only.\n\nIn view of the advances in medical therapy across the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, the Task Force has designated the term guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) to represent optimal medical therapy as defined by ACCF/AHA guideline-recommended therapies (primarily Class I). This new term, GDMT, will be used throughout subsequent guidelines.\n\nBecause the ACCF/AHA practice guidelines address patient populations (and healthcare providers) residing in North America, drugs that are not currently available in North America are discussed in the text without a specific COR. For studies performed in large numbers of subjects outside North America, each writing committee reviews the potential influence of different practice patterns and patient populations on the treatment effect and relevance to the ACCF/AHA target population to determine whether the findings should inform a specific recommendation.\n\nThe ACCF/AHA practice guidelines are intended to assist healthcare providers in clinical decision making by describing a range of generally acceptable approaches to the diagnosis, management, and prevention of specific diseases or conditions. The guidelines attempt to define practices that meet the needs of most patients in most circumstances. The ultimate judgment regarding care of a particular patient must be made by the healthcare provider and patient in light of all the circumstances presented by that patient. As a result, situations may arise for which deviations from these guidelines may be appropriate. Clinical decision making should involve consideration of the quality and availability of expertise in the area where care is provided. When these guidelines are used as the basis for regulatory or payer decisions, the goal should be improvement in quality of care. The Task Force recognizes that situations arise in which additional data are needed to inform patient care more effectively; these areas are identified within each respective guideline when appropriate.\n\nPrescribed courses of treatment in accordance with these recommendations are effective only if followed. Because lack of patient understanding and adherence may adversely affect outcomes, physicians and other healthcare providers should make every effort to engage the patient\u0027s active participation in prescribed medical regimens and lifestyles. In addition, patients should be informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives to a particular treatment and should be involved in shared decision making whenever feasible, particularly for COR IIa and IIb, for which the benefit-to-risk ratio may be lower.\n\nThe Task Force makes every effort to avoid actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) among the members of the writing committee. All writing committee members and peer reviewers of the guideline are required to disclose all current healthcare related relationships, including those existing 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. In December 2009, the ACCF and AHA implemented a new RWI policy that requires the writing committee chair plus a minimum of 50% of the writing committee to have no relevant RWI. (Appendix 1 includes the ACCF/AHA definition of relevance.) These statements are reviewed by the Task Force and all members during each conference call and/or meeting of the writing committee, and members provide updates as changes occur. All guideline recommendations require a confidential vote by the writing committee and must be approved by a consensus of the voting members. Members may not draft or vote on any text or recommendations pertaining to their RWI. Members who recused themselves from voting are indicated in the list of writing committee members, and specific section recusals are noted in Appendix 1. Authors\u0027 and peer reviewers\u0027 RWI pertinent to this guideline are disclosed in Appendixes Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. In addition, to ensure complete transparency, writing committee members\u0027 comprehensive disclosure information—including RWI not pertinent to this document—is available as an online supplement. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available online at http://www.cardiosource.org/ACC/About-ACC/Who-We-Are/Leadership/Guidelines-and-Documents-Task-Forces.aspx. The work of writing committees is supported exclusively by the ACCF and AHA without commercial support. Writing committee members volunteered their time for this activity.\n\nIn an effort to maintain relevance at the point of care for practicing physicians, the Task Force continues to oversee an ongoing process improvement initiative. As a result, in response to pilot projects, several changes to these guidelines will be apparent, including limited narrative text, a focus on summary and evidence tables (with references linked to abstracts in PubMed), and more liberal use of summary recommendation tables (with references that support LOE) to serve as a quick reference.\n\nIn April 2011, the Institute of Medicine released 2 reports: Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for Systematic Reviews and Clinical Practice Guidelines We Can Trust (2,3). It is noteworthy that the IOM cited ACCF/AHA practice guidelines as being compliant with many of the proposed standards. A thorough review of these reports and of our current methodology is under way, with further enhancements anticipated.\n\nThe recommendations in this guideline are considered current until they are superseded by a focused update or the full-text guideline is revised. Guidelines are official policy of both the ACCF and AHA.\n\nJeffrey L.

Key search words included but were not limited to: acute coronary syndromes, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, myocardial infarction, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, coronary stent, revascularization, anticoagulant therapy, antiplatelet therapy, antithrombotic therapy, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy, pharmacotherapy, proton-pump inhibitor, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy, cardiogenic shock, fibrinolytic therapy, thrombolytic therapy, nitrates, mechanical complications, arrhythmia, angina, chronic stable angina, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, mortality, morbidity, elderly, ethics, and contrast nephropathy. Additional searches cross-referenced these topics with the following subtopics: percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass graft, cardiac rehabilitation, and secondary prevention. Additionally, the committee reviewed documents related to the subject matter previously published by the ACCF and AHA. References selected and published in this document are representative and not all-inclusive.\n\nTo provide clinicians with a comprehensive set of data, whenever deemed appropriate or when published, the absolute risk difference and number needed to treat or harm are provided in the guideline, along with confidence intervals (CI) and data related to the relative treatment effects such as odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), hazard ratio (HR), or incidence rate ratio.\n\nThe focus of this guideline is the management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Updates to the 2004 STEMI guideline were published in 2007 and 2009 (4,5,6). Particular emphasis is placed on advances in reperfusion therapy, organization of regional systems of care, transfer algorithms, evidence-based antithrombotic and medical therapies, and secondary prevention strategies to optimize patient-centered care. By design, the document is narrower in scope than the 2004 STEMI Guideline, in an attempt to provide a more focused tool for practitioners. References related to management guidelines are provided whenever appropriate, including those pertaining to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), heart failure (HF), cardiac devices, and secondary prevention.\n\nThe writing committee was composed of experts representing cardiovascular medicine, interventional cardiology, electrophysiology, HF, cardiac surgery, emergency medicine, internal medicine, cardiac rehabilitation, nursing, and pharmacy. The American College of Physicians, American College of Emergency Physicians, and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions assigned official representatives.\n\nThis document was reviewed by 2 outside reviewers each nominated by the ACCF and the AHA, as well as 2 reviewers each from the American College of Emergency Physicians and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions and 22 individual content reviewers (including members from the ACCF Interventional Scientific Council and ACCF Surgeons\u0027 Scientific Council). All reviewer RWI information was distributed to the writing committee and is published in this document (Appendix 2).\n\nThis document was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACCF and the AHA and was endorsed by the American College of Emergency Physicians and Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions.\nBackground\n\nSTEMI is a clinical syndrome defined by characteristic symptoms of myocardial ischemia in association with persistent electrocardiographic (ECG) ST elevation and subsequent release of biomarkers of myocardial necrosis. Diagnostic ST elevation in the absence of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy or left bundle-branch block (LBBB) is defined by the European Society of Cardiology/ACCF/AHA/World Heart Federation Task Force for the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction as new ST elevation at the J point in at least 2 contiguous leads of ≥2 mm (0.2 mV) in men or ≥1.5 mm (0.15 mV) in women in leads V2–V3 and/or of ≥1 mm (0.1 mV) in other contiguous chest leads or the limb leads (7). The majority of patients will evolve ECG evidence of Q-wave infarction. New or presumably new LBBB has been considered a STEMI equivalent. Most cases of LBBB at time of presentation, however, are “not known to be old” because of prior electrocardiogram (ECG) is not available for comparison. New or presumably new LBBB at presentation occurs infrequently, may interfere with ST-elevation analysis, and should not be considered diagnostic of acute myocardial infarction (MI) in isolation (8). Criteria for ECG diagnosis of acute STEMI in the setting of LBBB have been proposed (see Online Data Supplement 1). Baseline ECG abnormalities other than LBBB (e.g., paced rhythm, LV hypertrophy, Brugada syndrome) may obscure interpretation. In addition, ST depression in ≥2 precordial leads (V1–V4) may indicate transmural posterior injury; multilead ST depression with coexistent ST elevation in lead aVR has been described in patients with left main or proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion (9). Rarely, hyperacute T-wave changes may be observed in the very early phase of STEMI, before the development of ST elevation. Transthoracic echocardiography may provide evidence of focal wall motion abnormalities and facilitate triage in patients with ECG findings that are difficult to interpret. If doubt persists, immediate referral for invasive angiography may be necessary to guide therapy in the appropriate clinical context (10,11). Cardiac troponin is the preferred biomarker for diagnosis of MI.\n\nIn 2009, approximately 683,000 patients were discharged from U.S. hospitals with a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Community incidence rates for STEMI have declined over the past decade, whereas those for non–ST-elevation ACS have increased (Figure 1). At present, STEMI comprises approximately 25% to 40% of MI presentations (12,13,14,15). In-hospital (approximately 5% to 6%) and 1-year (approximately 7% to 18%) mortality rates from STEMI also have decreased significantly in association with a substantial increase in the frequency of care that includes GDMT and interventions (“defect-free” care) (13,15,16,17,18). In the United States, important regional differences exist in 30-day acute MI hospital mortality and readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries ≥65 years of age (19). Understanding the reasons for such differences may provide opportunities for performance improvement (20).\n\nFigure 1\n\nAge- and sex-adjusted incidence rates of acute MI, 1999 to 2008.

Female sex was a strong independent predictor of failure to receive reperfusion therapy among patients who had no contraindications in the CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes with Early Implementation of the ACC/AHA Guidelines) registry (21). Compared with men, women included in the NCDR (National Cardiovascular Data Registry) ACTION Registry–GWTG (Get With The Guidelines) presented later after symptom onset, had longer door-to-fibrinolysis and door-to-balloon (or device) (D2B) times, and less often received aspirin or beta blockers within 24 hours of presentation. Women further were characterized by a higher risk for bleeding with antithrombotic therapy, which persisted after consideration of age, weight, blood pressure (BP) at presentation, renal function, baseline hematocrit, and other potential confounders (22).\n\nNonwhites represented 13.3% of patients with STEMI at hospitals participating in the ACTION Registry–GWTG in quarters 1 and 2 of 2009 (17). Importantly, disparities in the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities appear to be improving over time (23). In an assessment of the effects of a statewide program for treatment of STEMI, institution of a coordinated regional approach to triage and management was associated with significant improvements in treatment times that were similar for whites and blacks and for women and men (23). The writing committee endorses the desirability of collecting and using accurate data on patient race and ethnicity to detect disparities, guide quality improvement initiatives, and strengthen ties to the community (24).\n\nApproximately 23% of patients with STEMI in the United States have diabetes mellitus (17), and three quarters of all deaths among patients with diabetes mellitus are related to coronary artery disease (25,26). Diabetes mellitus is associated with higher short- and long-term mortality after STEMI (27,28), and in patients with diabetes mellitus, both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia are associated with worse outcomes (29). Hyperglycemia at presentation in patients who do not have diabetes mellitus by history has been associated with worse hospital outcomes (30,31,32,33,34). Myocardial tissue perfusion after restoration of epicardial coronary flow was more impaired among patients with diabetes mellitus (“no-reflow”) (28,35,36). Management of patients with diabetes mellitus and STEMI should be the same as for patients without diabetes mellitus, with attention to moderate glycemic control.\n\nThe elderly comprise a growing segment of the population and present special challenges for diagnosis and management that may lead to disparities in care and delays in treatment. Additional issues to consider include the risks of antithrombotic and interventional therapies and the appropriate boundaries of care within the context of individual comorbidities, frailty, and advanced-care directives. Clinical trials frequently have limited enrollment of older populations (37). Treatments that are effective in younger populations usually are indicated in the elderly, with the caveat that the elderly more often have absolute or relative contraindications to their use. Impaired renal function associated with aging requires careful attention to drug dosing (38,39).\n\nIn an analysis of 8,578 patients with STEMI from 226 U.S. hospitals participating in the CRUSADE quality improvement initiative from September 2004 to December 2006, 7% of eligible patients did not receive reperfusion therapy (21). The factor most strongly associated with not providing reperfusion therapy in eligible patients was increasing age. Evidence suggests that even the very elderly have reasonable post-MI outcomes when treated aggressively with reperfusion therapy (40), though individual circumstances vary.\n\nBoth the GWTG Quality Improvement Program and the North Carolina Reperfusion of Acute Myocardial Infarction in Carolina Emergency Department\u0027s initiative demonstrated that focused quality improvement efforts and programs designed to systematize care across integrated regional centers can lessen disparities and improve the care of elderly patients with STEMI (23,41).\n\nNumerous studies have highlighted the fact that patients with chronic kidney disease of all stages less frequently receive guideline-recommended interventions than do patients with normal renal function, despite evidence of benefit from most acute treatments (42,43,44,45). In a project that linked the U.S. Renal Data System database with the NRMI (National Registry of Myocardial Infarction)–3, patients on dialysis had longer prehospital delays, were less often recognized as having an acute MI, and less often had ST elevation or LBBB on initial ECG than patients not on dialysis. Only 45% of eligible patients on dialysis received reperfusion therapy, and only 70% received aspirin on admission. The in-hospital mortality rate was 21.3% among patients on dialysis, compared with 11.7% for patients with end-stage renal failure not on dialysis. At discharge, only 67% of patients on dialysis were prescribed aspirin, and only 57% were prescribed beta blockers. In the GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) registry, the in-hospital mortality rate was approximately 30% among patients with STEMI or LBBB MI with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease. Both fibrinolysis and primary PCI were associated with higher bleeding rates in patients with severely reduced renal function (46). Progressive renal dysfunction is a strong predictor of bleeding with antithrombotic therapy, a risk that may reflect intrinsic renal dysfunction and/or failure to adjust or avoid antithrombotic medications that are dependent on renal elimination (22,47).\n\nGlobal risk assessment provides an opportunity to integrate various patient characteristics into a semiquantitative score that can convey an overall estimate of a patient\u0027s prognosis; can dictate the acuity, intensity, and location of care; and can provide the patient and family with a more informed sense of potential outcome. Higher risk scores generally imply that higher-intensity treatments may be appropriate within the context of the patient\u0027s health status.\n\nSome of the independent predictors of early death from STEMI include age, Killip class, time to reperfusion, cardiac arrest, tachycardia, hypotension, anterior infarct location, prior infarction, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, renal function, and biomarker findings (48,49). Whereas the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score was developed specifically in patients with STEMI (http://www.mdcalc.com/timi-risk-score-for-stemi), the GRACE model (http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace/acs_risk/acs_risk_content.html) predicts in-hospital and 6-month mortality rate across the spectrum of patients presenting with ACS, including those with ST elevation or ST depression. Risk assessment is a continuous process that should be repeated throughout hospitalization and at time of discharge.\nOnset of MI\n\nPatients with STEMI do not seek medical care for approximately 1.5 to 2 hours after symptom onset, and little change in this interval has occurred over the past 10 years (50,51). Patient delay times are often longer in women, blacks, the elderly, and Medicaid-only recipients and are shorter for Medicare recipients (compared with privately insured patients) and patients who are taken directly to the hospital by emergency medical services (EMS) transport (52,53). Patients may delay seeking care because their symptoms differ from their preexisting bias that a heart attack should present dramatically with severe, crushing chest pain (54). Approximately one third of patients with MI experience symptoms other than chest pain (7). Other reasons for delay in seeking treatment include 1) inappropriate reasoning that symptoms will be self-limited or are not serious (55,56,57); 2) attribution of symptoms to other preexisting conditions; 3) fear of embarrassment should symptoms turn out to be a “false alarm”; 4) reluctance to trouble others unless “really sick” (55,57,58); 5) preconceived stereotypes of who is at risk for a heart attack, an especially common trait among women (59); 6) lack of knowledge of the importance of rapid action, the benefits of calling EMS or 9-1-1, and the availability of reperfusion therapies (54); and 7) attempted self-treatment with prescription and/or nonprescription medications (57). To avoid such delays, healthcare providers should assist patients when possible in making anticipatory plans for timely recognition and response to an acute event. Family members, close friends, or advocates also should be enlisted as reinforcement for rapid action when the patient experiences symptoms of possible STEMI (60,61). Discussions should include a review of instructions for taking aspirin (62) and nitroglycerin in response to chest pain. Emergency medical dispatchers are trained to instruct patients with possible STEMI symptoms to chew non–enteric-coated aspirin (162 to 325 mg), unless contraindicated, while personnel are en route. If nitroglycerin is prescribed, the patient should be advised to take 1 nitroglycerin dose promptly. If symptoms are unimproved or worsening 5 minutes after 1 dose, the patient should be instructed to call 9-1-1 immediately.\n\nEven though \u003e98% of the U.S. population is covered by 9-1-1 service (63), patients with STEMI often do not call EMS or 9-1-1 and are not transported to the hospital by ambulance. In a 2011 observational study from the ACTION Registry–GWTG that used data reported from a limited number of predominantly PCI-capable U.S. hospitals, EMS transport was used for only 60% of 37,643 patients with STEMI (64). Older U.S. surveys reported EMS activation rates of 23% to 53%, with substantial geographic variability (62,65,66).\n\nPatients with possible ischemic symptoms should be transported to the hospital by ambulance rather than by friends or relatives because 1) 1 in every 300 patients with chest pain transported to the emergency department (ED) by private vehicle suffers cardiac arrest en route (67); and 2) there is a significant association between arrival at the ED by ambulance and earlier delivery of reperfusion therapy (64,65,66,68). In addition, the performance of prehospital ECGs by trained personnel is associated with shorter reperfusion times (69) and lower mortality rates from STEMI. The use of prehospital ECGs, particularly when coupled with communication of STEMI diagnosis and preferential transport to a PCI-capable hospital, has been shown to result in rapid reperfusion times and excellent clinical outcomes (70,71,72).\n\nThe AHA and National Institutes of Health “Act in Time to Heart Attack Signs” campaign (73) stresses that patients can increase their chance of surviving STEMI by learning the warning symptoms, filling out a survival plan, and discussing risk reduction with their physician. These materials are available on the National Institutes of Health “Heart Attack” Web page (http://health.nih.gov/topic/HeartAttack/) (74). Healthcare providers should target their educational interventions to patients at increased risk for ACS (75).\n\nSee Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2\n\nReperfusion therapy for patients with STEMI. The bold arrows and boxes are the preferred strategies. Performance of PCI is dictated by an anatomically appropriate culprit stenosis. *Patients with cardiogenic shock or severe heart failure initially seen at a non–PCI-capable hospital should be transferred for cardiac catheterization and revascularization as soon as possible, irrespective of time delay from MI onset (Class I, LOE: B). †Angiography and revascularization should not be performed within the first 2 to 3 hours after administration of fibrinolytic therapy.

Performance can be facilitated by participating in programs such as Mission: Lifeline and the D2B Alliance (71,76,77,78). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2Performance of a 12-lead ECG by EMS personnel at the site of first medical contact (FMC) is recommended in patients with symptoms consistent with STEMI (70,71,72,79,80). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    3Reperfusion therapy should be administered to all eligible patients with STEMI with symptom onset within the prior 12 hours (81,82). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    4Primary PCI is the recommended method of reperfusion when it can be performed in a timely fashion by experienced operators (82,83,84). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    5EMS transport directly to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI is the recommended triage strategy for patients with STEMI, with an ideal FMC-to-device time system goal of 90 minutes or less⁎\n\n    ⁎ ⁎The proposed time windows are system goals. For any individual patient, every effort should be made to provide reperfusion therapy as rapidly as possible.\n    (70,71,72). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    6Immediate transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI is the recommended triage strategy for patients with STEMI who initially arrive at or are transported to a non–PCI-capable hospital, with an FMC-to-device time system goal of 120 minutes or less⁎(83,84,85,86). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    7In the absence of contraindications, fibrinolytic therapy should be administered to patients with STEMI at non–PCI-capable hospitals when the anticipated FMC-to-device time at a PCI-capable hospital exceeds 120 minutes because of unavoidable delays (81,87,88). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    8When fibrinolytic therapy is indicated or chosen as the primary reperfusion strategy, it should be administered within 30 minutes of hospital arrival⁎(89,90,91,92,93). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1Reperfusion therapy is reasonable for patients with STEMI and symptom onset within the prior 12 to 24 hours who have clinical and/or ECG evidence of ongoing ischemia. Primary PCI is the preferred strategy in this population (81,94,95). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nAny regional medical system must seek to enable rapid recognition and timely reperfusion of patients with STEMI. System delays to reperfusion are correlated with higher rates of mortality and morbidity (96,97,98,99,100). Although attention to certain performance metrics, such as D2B, door-to-needle, and door-in–door-out times, have catalyzed important institutional quality improvement efforts, broader initiatives at a systems level are required to reduce total ischemic time, the principal determinant of outcome (101,102). Questions have been raised about the overreliance on primary PCI for reperfusion, especially in the United States, and the unintended consequences that have evolved as familiarity with fibrinolysis has waned (101). The writing committee reiterates the principle highlighted in the 2004 ACC/AHA STEMI guideline, namely that “the appropriate and timely use of some form of reperfusion therapy is likely more important than the choice of therapy” (4). Greatest emphasis is to be placed on the delivery of reperfusion therapy to the individual patient as rapidly as possible.\n\nOnly a minority of U.S. hospitals are capable of performing primary PCI (103), and any delay in time to reperfusion (D2B) after hospital arrival is associated with a higher adjusted risk of in-hospital mortality in a continuous, nonlinear fashion (96). Strict time goals for reperfusion may not always be relevant or possible for patients who have an appropriate reason for delay, including initial uncertainty about diagnosis, the need for evaluation and treatment of other life-threatening conditions (e.g., acute respiratory failure, cardiac arrest), delays involving informed consent, and long transport times due to geographic distance or adverse weather. To reduce hospital treatment delays, the ACC initiated the D2B Alliance in 2006 to improve door-to-device times in patients with STEMI (104). The D2B Alliance goal was for participating PCI-capable hospitals to achieve a D2B time of ≤90 minutes for at least 75% of nontransferred patients with STEMI. The Alliance met this goal by 2008 (105). A longitudinal study of hospitals participating in the NCDR CathPCI Registry demonstrated that patients treated in hospitals that had been enrolled in the D2B Alliance for ≥3 months were significantly more likely to have D2B times of ≤90 minutes than patients treated in nonenrolled hospitals (105).\n\nIn a similar manner, the AHA launched “Mission: Lifeline” in 2007 to improve health system readiness and response to STEMI (106,107), with a focus on the continuum of care from EMS activation to primary PCI. Patients may present directly by private transport to a PCI-capable hospital, in which case all medical care occurs in a single center responsible for optimizing door-to-device times. For patients who call 9-1-1, direct care begins with FMC, defined as the time at which the EMS provider arrives at the patient\u0027s side. EMS personnel should be accountable for obtaining a prehospital ECG, making the diagnosis, activating the system, and deciding whether to transport the patient to a PCI-capable or non–PCI-capable hospital. Consideration should be given to the development of local protocols that allow preregistration and direct transport to the catheterization laboratory of a PCI-capable hospital (bypassing the ED) for patients who do not require emergent stabilization upon arrival. Although “false positives” are a concern when EMS personnel and/or emergency physicians are allowed to activate the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the rate of false activations is relatively low (approximately 15%) and is more than balanced by earlier treatment times for the majority of patients for whom notification is appropriate (108,109,110,111,112,113,114). The concept of what constitutes false activation is evolving (115,116). For patients who arrive at or are transported by EMS to a non–PCI-capable hospital, a decision about whether to transfer immediately to a PCI-capable hospital or to administer fibrinolytic therapy must be made. Each of these scenarios involves coordination of different elements of the system. On the basis of model systems of STEMI care in the United States and Europe, (77,78,117,118,119,120,121) Mission: Lifeline recommends a multifaceted community-wide approach that involves patient education, improvements in EMS and ED care, establishment of networks of STEMI-referral (non–PCI-capable) and STEMI-receiving (PCI-capable) hospitals, and coordinated advocacy efforts to work with payers and policy makers to implement healthcare system redesign. Detailed information about this program can be found on the AHA website (122).\n\nSeveral factors should be considered in selecting the type of reperfusion therapy (Figure 2). For patients with STEMI presenting to a PCI-capable hospital, primary PCI should be accomplished within 90 minutes. For patients presenting to a non–PCI-capable hospital, rapid assessment of 1) the time from onset of symptoms, 2) the risk of complications related to STEMI, 3) the risk of bleeding with fibrinolysis, 4) the presence of shock or severe HF, and 5) the time required for transfer to a PCI-capable hospital must be made and a decision about administration of fibrinolytic therapy reached. Even when interhospital transfer times are short, there may be relative advantages to a strategy of immediate fibrinolytic therapy versus any delay to primary PCI for eligible patients who present within the first 1 to 2 hours after symptom onset (89,101,123,124).\n\nSeveral trials have suggested a benefit of transferring patients with STEMI from a non–PCI-capable hospital to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI (83,125), but in many instances, transfer times are prolonged and delays may be unavoidable. In the NCDR (126,127), only 10% of transferred patients were treated within 90 minutes of initial presentation, with a median first door-to-device time of 149 minutes. In many communities, a significant percentage of patients with STEMI who present initially to a non–PCI-capable hospital cannot physically be transferred to a PCI-capable hospital and achieve an FMC-to-device time treatment goal of ≤90 minutes. DANAMI-2 (Danish Multicenter Randomized Study on Thrombolytic Therapy Versus Acute Coronary Angioplasty in Acute Myocardial Infarction) showed that a reperfusion strategy involving the transfer of patients with STEMI from a non–PCI-capable hospital to a PCI-capable hospital for primary PCI was superior to the use of fibrinolysis at the referring hospital, driven primarily by a reduction in the rate of reinfarction in the primary PCI–treated group (83,85). In this study, the average first door-to-device time delay was approximately 110 minutes (85). Shorter system delays were associated with a reduced mortality rate for both fibrinolysis- and primary PCI–treated patients. In an analysis of approximately 19,000 propensity score–matched patients with STEMI from NRMI-2, -3, -4, and -5, when delays related to transfer for primary PCI exceeded 120 minutes from FMC, the survival advantage of primary PCI over fibrinolysis was negated. Delays beyond 120 minutes occurred in nearly half the patients in the analysis (100). Thus, interhospital transfer to a PCI-capable hospital is the recommended triage strategy if primary PCI consistently can be performed within 120 minutes of FMC. Fibrinolytic therapy, in the absence of contraindications to its use, should be administered within 30 minutes of first door arrival when this 120-minute time goal cannot be met. Transfer delays can occur at multiple levels and for varied reasons (128). Efforts are needed to reduce the time delay between arrival to and transfer from a non–PCI-capable hospital (i.e., door-in–door-out). Among a subset of 14,821 patients in the NCDR ACTION–GWTG registry, the median door-in–door-out time was 68 minutes (interquartile range, 43 to 120 minutes). A door-in–door-out time ≤30 minutes, achieved in only 11% of patients, was associated with shorter delays to reperfusion and a lower in-hospital mortality rate (129). Because estimation of treatment times for patients can be inaccurate, the decision to transfer for primary PCI should be based on actual, historical times achieved within the regional system, with quality assurance programs to ensure that such goals are consistently met. A reasonable goal would be that 90% of patients should meet the 120-minute time-to-treatment standard to achieve performance standards.\n\nSeveral triage and transfer strategies have been tested and are discussed further in Section 5.3. The term facilitated PCI was used previously to describe a strategy of full- or half-dose fibrinolysis, with or without administration of a glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, with immediate transfer for planned PCI within 90 to 120 minutes. Two large studies failed to show a net clinical benefit with this strategy (130,131). The term rescue PCI refers to the transfer for PCI of patients who demonstrate findings of failed reperfusion with fibrinolysis (103,130). The term pharmacoinvasive strategy refers to the administration of fibrinolytic therapy either in the prehospital setting or at a non–PCI-capable hospital, followed by immediate transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for early coronary angiography and PCI when appropriate. Patients with STEMI who are best suited for immediate interhospital transfer for primary PCI without fibrinolysis are those patients who present with shock or other high-risk features, those with high bleeding risk with fibrinolytic therapy, and those who present \u003e3 to 4 hours after symptom onset and who have short transfer times. Patients best suited for initial fibrinolytic therapy are those with low bleeding risk who present very early after symptom onset (\u003c2 to 3 hours) to a non–PCI-capable hospital and who have longer delay to PCI.\n\nBecause patients with STEMI may first present with cardiac arrest, regional systems also should emphasize early access to care (recognition of the problem and bystander activation of EMS), rapid dispatch, bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation when indicated, advanced cardiac life support, and an organized approach to postresuscitation care. In addition, family members of patients who have had STEMI or other manifestations of coronary artery disease should be referred to CPR training programs that have a social support component and can familiarize them with the use of automated external defibrillators.\n\nThe D2B time interval includes 3 key components: door-to-ECG time, ECG–to–catheterization laboratory time, and laboratory arrival–to–device time (132). All 3 intervals are dependent on system factors that may vary across institutions (132).\n\nPublic reporting and national initiatives have focused much attention on D2B times (104,133) and the many reasons for system delays (134). Studies have shown marked differences in the timeliness of primary PCI across hospitals. Focusing on the processes of care at the top-performing institutions, research has revealed characteristics of institutions associated with exemplary performance (124). Top hospitals have specific cultural attributes that include 1) a commitment to an explicit goal of improving D2B times that is motivated by internal and external pressures, including senior management support; 2) innovative protocols; 3) flexibility in refining standardized protocols; 4) uncompromising individual clinical leaders; 5) collaborative teams; 6) data feedback to monitor progress, identify problems, and successes; and 7) an organizational culture that fosters resilience to challenges or setbacks to improvement efforts (135). In addition, several key processes are associated strongly with more timely treatment (Checklist). Other studies have indicated that PCI-capable hospitals receiving patients in transfer can reduce their D2B times by coordinating with the referring hospitals and activating their systems while patients are being transported (78).\n\nChecklistImproving Door-to-Device Times\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nCurrently, it is estimated that almost 90% of patients presenting to a hospital with PCI capability and without a clinical reason for delay have a D2B time ≤90 minutes (136). Some innovative programs are achieving much faster times (137,138,139). In addition, with improvements in timeliness of care across the country, racial disparities in reperfusion times have been reduced significantly (140). In an analysis of patients with STEMI reported by hospitals to the Centers for Medicare \u0026 Medicaid Services, median D2B times fell from 96 minutes in the year ending December 31, 2005, to 64 minutes in the 3 quarters ending September 30, 2010. This decline was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of patients with D2B times \u003c90 minutes, from 44.2% to 91.4% (141). Nevertheless, despite substantial improvements in D2B times, evidence that these efforts have translated into reduced mortality rates is lacking. The absence of demonstrated benefit may relate to reduced power to show change in survival in a population with a relatively low mortality rate, improved early survival of higher-risk patients, and changing STEMI demographics. These findings support the goal of comprehensive efforts to improve all aspects of acute MI care to improve survival rates.\n\nThe time delay from symptom onset to treatment can be shortened by administration of prehospital fibrinolytic therapy by a trained EMS unit either with a physician on board (142,143,144,145,146,147) or with a hospital-based physician (148,149,150,151,152) in direct contact, especially in rural areas. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of prehospital fibrinolytic therapy, with decreased treatment times ranging from 30 to 140 minutes (142,143,145,146,147,149,150,151,153). A meta-analysis of 6 higher-quality RCTs revealed an approximately 60-minute reduction in time from symptom onset to delivery of fibrinolytic therapy with prehospital versus hospital-based administration, with a corresponding 17% reduction in risk of all-cause hospital mortality (154). Analysis of a subgroup of patients enrolled in the CAPTIM (Comparaison de l\u0027Angioplastie Primaire et de la Thrombolyse) trial within 2 hours of symptom onset showed a significantly lower 5-year mortality rate for patients treated with prehospital fibrinolysis than for patients managed with primary PCI (p=0.04) (123,142). These salutary results for early presenters were confirmed in a subsequent analysis of combined data from the CAPTIM and WEST (Which Early ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Therapy) trials (155). Data from the USIC (Unité de Soins Intensifs Coronaires) Registry and the Swedish Registry of Cardiac Intensive Care also suggest that prehospital fibrinolytic therapy may lower STEMI mortality rates (144,148).\n\nAt the present time, however, prehospital fibrinolytic therapy is not used in most communities in the United States. EMS in rural areas, where prehospital fibrinolysis would potentially be of benefit, often have neither the resources to train paramedics nor the funding for necessary equipment. Use of prehospital fibrinolysis is more widespread in some regions of Europe and the United Kingdom. The writing committee endorses the need for further research into the implementation of prehospital strategies to reduce total ischemic time.\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Therapeutic hypothermia should be started as soon as possible in comatose patients with STEMI and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), including patients who undergo primary PCI (156,157,158). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2Immediate angiography and PCI when indicated should be performed in resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients whose initial ECG shows STEMI (159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170,171,172,173,174). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nSee Online Data Supplement 2 for additional data on PCI for cardiac arrest.\n\nAlmost 70% of the coronary heart disease deaths annually in the United States occur out of hospital, usually presenting as “sudden death” due to cardiac arrest (175). Resuscitation is attempted by EMS personnel in approximately 60% of these out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases; the remaining patients are deceased on arrival of the EMS team (175,176,177). Although only 23% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest cases have a shockable initial rhythm (primarily VF), the majority of neurologically intact survivors come from this subgroup (175,176). The median rate of survival to hospital discharge with any first recorded rhythm is only 7.9% (175); the rate of survival in patients who are in VF initially is much higher (median 22%, range 8% to 40%), as documented in 10 U.S. and Canadian regions participating in the National Institutes of Health–sponsored Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (176).\n\nSurvival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is optimal when both CPR and defibrillation are initiated early (178). Survival from VF specifically is inversely related to the time interval between its onset and termination, with the odds of survival decreasing 7% to 10% for each minute of delay from onset to defibrillation (178,179,180). The percentage of patients who are found in VF and the likelihood of survival are higher if the patient\u0027s collapse is witnessed, if bystander CPR is performed, and if a monitor/defibrillator can be applied quickly (181).\n\nCommunity strategies that improve the delivery of early defibrillation to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims include training and equipping first responders (fire and law enforcement), EMS personnel, and paramedics to defibrillate, as well as placing automated external defibrillators in highly populated locations such as airports, commercial aircraft, and gambling casinos (“public access defibrillation”) (182,183,184,185,186,187,188,189,190,191,192,193). The latter strategy has been shown to approximately double the number of neurologically intact out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors when laypersons are trained and equipped to provide early CPR and defibrillation with automated external defibrillators, compared with providing CPR alone while awaiting arrival of EMS personnel (183).\n\nTwo RCTs have reported improved rates of neurologically intact survival to hospital discharge when comatose patients with out-of-hospital VF or nonperfusing VT cardiac arrest were cooled to 32°C to 34°C for 12 or 24 hours beginning minutes to hours after the return of spontaneous circulation (157,158). Additional studies with historical control groups also have shown improved neurological outcomes after therapeutic hypothermia for comatose survivors of VF arrest (194,195). Accordingly, therapeutic hypothermia should be initiated in patients with STEMI and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Cooling should begin before or at the time of cardiac catheterization.\n\nApproximately 5% of patients with STEMI who survive to reach the hospital will experience a cardiac arrest during hospitalization (196). Reports from high-volume PCI centers indicate that 4% to 11% of patients with STEMI who are treated with PCI are brought to cardiac catheterization after being resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (77,197,198). However, the percentage of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims whose event is triggered by an acute coronary occlusion is less clear. The majority of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who cannot be resuscitated have significant coronary atherosclerosis (199). Coronary atherosclerosis is also present in the majority of cardiac arrest victims who survive and undergo coronary angiography (200). Because of the high prevalence of acute coronary artery occlusions in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who are resuscitated successfully, especially those whose initial rhythm is VF in the setting of STEMI, the AHA 2010 Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (201) recommend emergency coronary angiography with prompt opening of the infarct artery. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims with initial VF who survive to hospital admission have a rate of survival to hospital discharge of 60% after early PCI.\n\nThe AHA issued a policy statement calling for communities to establish regional systems of care for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (159). The statement defines 2 different levels of cardiac resuscitation centers and lists the essential elements of such a system. PCI-capable hospitals become ideal candidates to serve as Level I cardiac resuscitation centers that can offer a wide range of services, including timely PCI when indicated, a goal-directed care bundle (202,203), therapeutic hypothermia (157,158), frequent or continuous electroencephalographic monitoring, a multidisciplinary team approach, and neuropsychiatric evaluation for survivors. All other participating hospitals should be trained and equipped as Level II cardiac resuscitation centers, which are capable of initiating therapeutic hypothermia and transferring patients for primary postresuscitation care. Ideally, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes should be measured and compared within a dedicated registry. Lastly, it is important for organizations that collect and publicly report STEMI and PCI data to consider resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients separately from their hospital and individual operator quality “scorecards” because such patients, even with optimal care, have a much higher mortality rate than that of patients with STEMI who have not had a cardiac arrest (204,205,206). Public reporting in this instance might have the unintended consequence of reducing appropriate care (207).\nReperfusion at a PCI-Capable Hospital\n\nSee Table 2 for a summary of recommendations from this section.\n\nTable 2Primary PCI in STEMI\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Primary PCI should be performed in patients with STEMI and ischemic symptoms of less than 12 hours\u0027 duration (82,208,209).

(Level of Evidence: B)\n    3Primary PCI should be performed in patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock or acute severe HF, irrespective of time delay from MI onset (Section 9.1.1) (212,213,214,215). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1Primary PCI is reasonable in patients with STEMI if there is clinical and/or ECG evidence of ongoing ischemia between 12 and 24 hours after symptom onset (94,95). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS III: HARM\n\n    1PCI should not be performed in a noninfarct artery at the time of primary PCI in patients with STEMI who are hemodynamically stable (216,217,218). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nPrimary PCI of the infarct artery is preferred to fibrinolytic therapy when time-to-treatment delays are short and the patient presents to a high-volume, well-equipped center with experienced interventional cardiologists and skilled support staff. Compared with fibrinolytic therapy, primary PCI produces higher rates of infarct artery patency, TIMI 3 flow, and access site bleeding and lower rates of recurrent ischemia, reinfarction, emergency repeat revascularization procedures, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and death (82). Early, successful PCI also greatly decreases the complications of STEMI that result from longer ischemic times or unsuccessful fibrinolytic therapy, allowing earlier hospital discharge and resumption of daily activities. Primary PCI has its greatest survival benefit in high-risk patients. PCI outcomes have been shown to be worse with delays to treatment and with low-volume hospitals and operators. Quality metrics for both laboratory and operator performance and considerations with regard to primary PCI at hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery are reviewed in the 2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, Section 7 (219).\n\nPotential complications of primary PCI include problems with the arterial access site; adverse reactions to volume loading, contrast medium, and antithrombotic medications; technical complications; and reperfusion events. The “no-reflow” phenomenon refers to suboptimal myocardial perfusion despite restoration of epicardial flow in the infarct artery and has been attributed to the combined effects of inflammation, endothelial injury, edema, atheroembolization, vasospasm, and myocyte reperfusion injury (220). No-reflow is associated with a reduced survival rate. Treatment and prevention strategies have included use of the GP IIb/IIIa antagonist abciximab, vasodilators (nitroprusside, verapamil, adenosine), and inhibitors of various metabolic pathways (nicorandil, pexelizumab), albeit without consistent effect. Manual thrombus aspiration at the time of primary PCI results in improved tissue perfusion and more complete ST resolution (221,222) (Section 4.2), though not all studies have shown positive results (223).\n\nPCI of a noninfarct artery with TIMI 3 flow at the time of primary PCI in hemodynamically stable patients has been associated with worse clinical outcomes in several studies, (216,217,218,224) though others have suggested that it may be performed safely (225,226,227,228,229). Noninfarct artery PCI is not recommended in this context unless multiple complex lesions are seen on angiography and ECG localization of the infarct is ambiguous (230,231). Clinical stability may be defined broadly as the absence of low output, hypotension, persistent tachycardia, apparent shock, high-grade ventricular or symptomatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, and spontaneous recurrent ischemia. In patients with cardiogenic shock due to pump failure, PCI of a severe stenosis in a large noninfarct artery might improve hemodynamic stability and should be considered during the primary procedure (Section 9.1.1). In the majority of patients, delayed PCI can be performed in a noninfarct artery at a later time if indicated by clinical events or the results of noninvasive testing (218,232,233).\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1Manual aspiration thrombectomy is reasonable for patients undergoing primary PCI (221,223,234,235). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nTwo RCTs (221,235) and a meta-analysis (234) support the use of manual aspiration thrombectomy during primary PCI to improve microvascular reperfusion and to decrease deaths and adverse cardiac events. However, infarct size was not reduced by manual aspiration thrombectomy in the INFUSE-AMI (Intracoronary Abciximab Infusion and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention for Anterior ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction) trial of patients with large anterior STEMI (223). The trial was underpowered to detect differences in clinical outcomes. No clinical benefit for routine rheolytic thrombectomy has been demonstrated in primary PCI (234,236,237).\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Placement of a stent (bare-metal stent [BMS] or drug-eluting stent [DES]) is useful in primary PCI for patients with STEMI (238,239). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    2BMS†\n\n    † †Balloon angioplasty without stent placement may be used in selected patients.\n    should be used in patients with high bleeding risk, inability to comply with 1 year of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), or anticipated invasive or surgical procedures in the next year. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCLASS III: HARM\n\n    1DES should not be used in primary PCI for patients with STEMI who are unable to tolerate or comply with a prolonged course of DAPT because of the increased risk of stent thrombosis with premature discontinuation of one or both agents (240,241,242,243,244,245,246). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCoronary stents are used routinely at the time of primary PCI. Compared with balloon angioplasty, BMS implantation during primary PCI decreases the risk for subsequent target-lesion and target-vessel revascularization and possibly the risk for reinfarction, but is not associated with a reduction in the mortality rate (238). Compared with BMS, DES implantation decreases restenosis rates and the need for reintervention but does not definitively reduce rates of death or reinfarction. Notably, DES in this setting does not increase the risk of early or late stent thrombosis (242,243,244,245,247,248). Controversy remains as to whether the risk of very late stent thrombosis is higher with first-generation DES than with BMS (249). The lowest rates of stent thrombosis have been reported with cobalt-chromium everolimus-eluting stents (250). The greatest challenge in deciding the approach at the time of primary PCI, however, is determining emergently whether the patient is a candidate for a prolonged (i.e., 1-year) course of DAPT. DES should be avoided in the presence of financial or social barriers that may limit patient compliance, elevated bleeding risk, the anticipated need for invasive or surgical procedures in the subsequent year, or an independent indication for long-term anticoagulant therapy.\n\nSee Table 3 for a summary of recommendations from this section and Online Data Supplement 3 for additional information on antithrombotic therapy.\n\nTable 3Adjunctive Antithrombotic Therapy to Support Reperfusion With Primary PCI\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Aspirin 162 to 325 mg should be given before primary PCI (251,252,253). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2After PCI, aspirin should be continued indefinitely (254,255,257). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    3A loading dose of a P2Y12receptor inhibitor should be given as early as possible or at time of primary PCI to patients with STEMI.

(Level of Evidence: B)\n    2It is reasonable to begin treatment with an intravenous GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist such as abciximab (265,266,267) (Level of Evidence: A), high-bolus-dose tirofiban (268,269) (Level of Evidence: B), or double-bolus eptifibatide (270) (Level of Evidence: B) at the time of primary PCI (with or without stenting or clopidogrel pretreatment) in selected patients with STEMI who are receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH).\n\nCLASS IIb\n\n    1It may be reasonable to administer intravenous GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist in the precatheterization laboratory setting (e.g., ambulance, ED) to patients with STEMI for whom primary PCI is intended (103,268,271,272,273,274,275,276,277). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2It may be reasonable to administer intracoronary abciximab to patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI (223,278,279,280,281,282,283,284). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    3Continuation of a P2Y12inhibitor beyond 1 year may be considered in patients undergoing DES placement. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCLASS III: HARM\n\n    1Prasugrel should not be administered to patients with a history of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (260). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nAlthough the minimum effective aspirin dose in the setting of PCI for STEMI has not been established prospectively, the writing committee recommends that an empiric dose of 325 mg be given as early as possible before PCI and a maintenance dose continued indefinitely thereafter. It is the consensus of the writing committee that the 81-mg maintenance dose is preferred even among patients who receive a stent during primary PCI. This recommendation is based on evidence of an increased risk of bleeding in most studies comparing higher- with lower-dose aspirin (253,254,263,264), as well as the absence of data from RCTs demonstrating superior efficacy of higher aspirin doses in this setting. However, because the CURRENT-OASIS 7 (Clopidogrel Optimal Loading Dose Usage to Reduce Recurrent Events–Organization to Assess Strategies in Ischemic Syndromes) trial did not report differences in either efficacy or safety in patients with STEMI randomized to 81 mg versus 325 mg of aspirin, the committee did not think that the evidence favoring 81 mg over higher dosages was sufficiently conclusive to merit a Class I recommendation (253).\n\nLoading doses of P2Y12 inhibitors are provided before or at the time of primary PCI. These agents are continued in a maintenance dose for 1 year after PCI with a stent (BMS or DES) in the absence of bleeding. A 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel is preferred to a 300-mg loading dose, given the more extensive and rapid platelet inhibition achieved with the higher dose, as well as the beneficial effects reported in a CURRENT-OASIS 7 subgroup analysis (259). The underpowered ARMYDA-6 MI (Antiplatelet Therapy for Reduction of Myocardial Damage During Angioplasty–Myocardial Infarction) study also reported beneficial surrogate outcomes with the higher clopidogrel loading dose (258).\n\nThe antiplatelet response to clopidogrel may vary as a function of patient phenotype (obesity, diabetes mellitus), enteric ABCB 1 polymorphisms, hepatic CYP450 enzyme system polymorphisms (predominantly CYP 2C19*2), and medications that interfere with clopidogrel biotransformation. Approximately 25% to 30% of patients may harbor a reduced-function CYP2C19 allele. In TRITON-TIMI 38 (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel—Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) (285) and 3 cohort studies (286,287,288), patients who were carriers of the reduced-function CYP2C19*2 allele had significantly lower levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel, diminished platelet inhibition, and increased rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and stent thrombosis (285). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has changed clopidogrel\u0027s prescribing information to highlight the potential impact of CYP2C19 genotype on clopidogrel pharmacokinetics and clinical response (289). Nevertheless, other studies have not confirmed associations between CYP2C19 polymorphisms and adverse outcomes in clopidogrel-treated patients (290). Future studies are needed to further clarify the risk associated with these genetic polymorphisms and to develop effective therapeutic strategies for carriers of allelic variants of responsible enzyme systems. Proton-pump inhibitors, most prominently omeprazole, can interfere with clopidogrel metabolism and result in diminished in vitro antiplatelet effect (291), but it does not appear that this pharmacokinetic effect translates into worse clinical outcomes (291,292).\n\nPrasugrel, an alternative thienopyridine, achieves greater inhibition of platelet aggregation than clopidogrel. In the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial(260) of prasugrel versus clopidogrel in patients with ACS for whom an invasive strategy was planned, patients with STEMI who were assigned to prasugrel had a lower 30-day rate of the composite primary outcome. This difference persisted to 15 months. In addition, the rate of stent thrombosis reported at 30 days was significantly lower with prasugrel (260,262). The loading dose of clopidogrel in TRITON-TIMI 38, which rarely was administered before coronary angiography and was limited to 300 mg, may have contributed to differences in efficacy and safety between treatment groups (262).\n\nThe benefits of prasugrel relative to clopidogrel in STEMI must be weighed against the increase in the risk of bleeding associated with its use. Prasugrel should not be administered to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack and was not shown to be beneficial in patients ≥75 years of age or patients who weigh \u003c60 kg (260). In TRITON-TIMI 38, interaction testing for efficacy and safety showed no significant difference in bleeding risk across the spectrum of ACS. Prasugrel may be best suited for younger patients with diabetes mellitus or large areas of myocardium at risk, who are also at low bleeding risk, have the ability to continue a regimen of DAPT, and have no anticipation of surgery over the subsequent year. The package insert for prasugrel suggests that a lower maintenance dose of 5 mg daily might be considered for patients at high risk of bleeding, though this dose has not been prospectively studied (293).\n\nTicagrelor is a reversible, nonthienopyridine P2Y12 receptor antagonist that does not require metabolic conversion to active drug. The PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) study compared ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily thereafter) with clopidogrel (300- or 600-mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter) for the prevention of cardiovascular events in 18,624 patients with ACS, of whom 35% had STEMI (294). Among the 7544 patients enrolled with ST elevation or LBBB who underwent primary PCI, findings were consistent with the overall trial results. Significant reductions favoring ticagrelor were seen in the primary PCI subgroup for stent thrombosis and total deaths, though there were more strokes and episodes of ICH with ticagrelor (261). A prespecified subgroup analysis in the PLATO trial showed a significant interaction between treatment effect and geographic region, with an apparently smaller ticagrelor effect in North America than in other areas. Although this interaction could have been due to chance alone (295), a contribution from higher aspirin doses, as more commonly used in the United States, cannot be excluded. When provided long term with ticagrelor as a component of DAPT, the dose of aspirin should not exceed 100 mg (293).\n\nAlthough 1 year of DAPT is recommended after stent implantation during primary PCI for STEMI, earlier discontinuation of a P2Y12 inhibitor may be necessary if the risk of morbidity from bleeding outweighs the anticipated benefit of DAPT. Clinical judgment is required, and discussion with the interventional cardiologist is recommended.\n\nDAPT with aspirin and either clopidogrel or prasugrel has increased the risk of ICH in several clinical trials and patient populations (especially in those with prior stroke) (260,296,297,298). In PLATO, the number of patients with prior stroke was small, limiting the power to detect treatment differences in intracranial bleeding in this subgroup (299). Until further data become available, it would seem prudent to weigh the possible increased risk of intracranial bleeding when the addition of ticagrelor to aspirin is considered in patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (300).\n\nEvidence to support the use of intravenous GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists in patients with STEMI was established largely before the use of oral DAPT. Although several studies have failed to show benefit with the administration of “upstream” GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists before primary PCI in the setting of DAPT with either UFH or bivalirudin anticoagulation, (103,268,271,272,273,274,275,276) a meta-analysis restricted to the use of abciximab has suggested it may be useful in this setting (277). The adjunctive use of GP IIb/IIIa agents at the time of PCI can be considered on an individual basis for large thrombus burden or inadequate P2Y12 receptor antagonist loading (265,266,267,268,269,270,301). For patients receiving bivalirudin as the primary anticoagulant, routine adjunctive use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors is not recommended (248) but may be considered as adjunctive or “bail-out” therapy in selected cases (223,301,302,303). Studies of intracoronary GP IIb/IIIa administration during primary PCI have shown mixed results for a variety of surrogate and combined clinical endpoints. Use of intracoronary abciximab may be reasonable in select cases (223,278,279,280,281,282,283,284).\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1For patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI, the following supportive anticoagulant regimens are recommended:\n        aUFH, with additional boluses administered as needed to maintain therapeutic activated clotting time levels, taking into account whether a GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist has been administered (Level of Evidence: C); or\n        bBivalirudin with or without prior treatment with UFH (248). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1In patients with STEMI undergoing PCI who are at high risk of bleeding, it is reasonable to use bivalirudin monotherapy in preference to the combination of UFH and a GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist (248). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS III: HARM\n\n    1Fondaparinux should not be used as the sole anticoagulant to support primary PCI because of the risk of catheter thrombosis (304). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nIntravenous UFH titrated to an appropriate activated clotting time is a familiar and well-tested strategy for anticoagulant therapy at the time of PCI for STEMI. Enoxaparin and fondaparinux have been studied less extensively in this setting. The ATOLL (Acute STEMI Treated with Primary PCI and IV Enoxaparin or UFH to Lower Ischemic and Bleeding Events at Short- and Long-term Follow-up) trial comparing intravenous enoxaparin with UFH for primary PCI failed to meet its primary, composite endpoint (305). Fondaparinux has been associated with catheter thrombosis in this setting (304). On the basis of the findings in the HORIZONS-AMI (Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial (248), the writing committee considers bivalirudin, in combination with oral DAPT, a reasonable anticoagulant alternative for primary PCI in STEMI, regardless of whether pretreatment was given with UFH, especially for patients at higher risk of bleeding and when avoidance of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists is desired. Bivalirudin in this setting may provide a long-term survival benefit related to decreased bleeding but with a higher risk of early stent thrombosis (248).\nReperfusion at a Non–PCI-Capable Hospital\n\nSee Table 4 for a summary of recommendations from this section.\n\nTable 4Indications for Fibrinolytic Therapy When There Is a \u003e120-Minute Delay From FMC to Primary PCI (Figure 2)\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1In the absence of contraindications, fibrinolytic therapy should be given to patients with STEMI and onset of ischemic symptoms within the previous 12 hours when it is anticipated that primary PCI cannot be performed within 120 minutes of FMC (81,306,307,308,309,310,311). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1In the absence of contraindications and when PCI is not available, fibrinolytic therapy is reasonable for patients with STEMI if there is clinical and/or ECG evidence of ongoing ischemia within 12 to 24 hours of symptom onset and a large area of myocardium at risk or hemodynamic instability. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCLASS III: HARM\n\n    1Fibrinolytic therapy should not be administered to patients with ST depression except when a true posterior (inferobasal) MI is suspected or when associated with ST elevation in lead aVR (10,11,81,312,313). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nThe benefits of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with ST elevation or bundle-branch block MI are well established, with a time-dependent reduction in both mortality and morbidity rates during the initial 12 hours after symptom onset (81,306,307,308,309,310,311,314,315,316,317,318,319,320). As noted in Section 3.2, even when interhospital transport times are short, there may be advantages to the immediate delivery of fibrinolytic therapy versus any delay to primary PCI for patients with STEMI and low bleeding risk who present within the first 1 to 2 hours of symptom onset (123,321). Benefit from fibrinolytic therapy in patients who present \u003e12 hours after symptom onset has not been established (81,307,309,322,323), although there remains consensus that consideration should be given to administering a fibrinolytic agent in symptomatic patients presenting \u003e12 hours after symptom onset with STEMI and a large area of myocardium at risk or hemodynamic instability if PCI is unavailable (4,48).\n\nTable 5 lists currently available fibrinolytic agents (314,324,325,326,328,329). Fibrin-specific agents are preferred when available. Adjunctive antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapies are indicated, regardless of the choice of fibrinolytic agent.\n\nTable 5Fibrinolytic Agents\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nAbsolute and relative contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy are listed in Table 6. The decision to use fibrinolytic therapy for patients with STEMI is predicated on a risk–benefit analysis that integrates time from onset of symptoms, the clinical and hemodynamic features at presentation, patient comorbidities, risk of bleeding, presence of contraindications, and time delay to PCI (Section 3.2).\n\nTable 6Contraindications and Cautions for Fibrinolytic Therapy in STEMI⁎\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nSee Table 7 for a summary of recommendations from this section.\n\nTable 7Adjunctive Antithrombotic Therapy to Support Reperfusion With Fibrinolytic Therapy\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Aspirin (162- to 325-mg loading dose) and clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose for patients ≤75 years of age, 75-mg dose for patients \u003e75 years of age) should be administered to patients with STEMI who receive fibrinolytic therapy (308,330,331). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    2Aspirin should be continued indefinitely (308,330,331) (Level of Evidence: A) and clopidogrel (75 mg daily) should be continued for at least 14 days (330,331) (Level of Evidence: A) and up to 1 year (Level of Evidence: C) in patients with STEMI who receive fibrinolytic therapy.\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1It is reasonable to use aspirin 81 mg per day in preference to higher maintenance doses after fibrinolytic therapy (254,257,263,264). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nThe beneficial effects of aspirin and clopidogrel with fibrinolytic therapy are well established (254,257,263,264). These agents should be given before or with the fibrinolytic (330). The recommendation that clopidogrel be continued for up to 1 year is extrapolated from the experience with DAPT in patients with non–ST-elevation ACS (330). The coadministration of other P2Y12 antagonists with fibrinolytic therapy has not been prospectively studied.\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Patients with STEMI undergoing reperfusion with fibrinolytic therapy should receive anticoagulant therapy for a minimum of 48 hours, and preferably for the duration of the index hospitalization, up to 8 days or until revascularization if performed (318,332). (Level of Evidence: A) Recommended regimens include\n        aUFH administered as a weight-adjusted intravenous bolus and infusion to obtain an activated partial thromboplastin time of 1.5 to 2.0 times control, for 48 hours or until revascularization (Level of Evidence: C);\n        bEnoxaparin administered according to age, weight, and creatinine clearance, given as an intravenous bolus, followed in 15 minutes by subcutaneous injection for the duration of the index hospitalization, up to 8 days or until revascularization (332,333,334,335) (Level of Evidence: A); or\n        cFondaparinux administered with initial intravenous dose, followed in 24 hours by daily subcutaneous injections if the estimated creatinine clearance is greater than 30 mL/min, for the duration of the index hospitalization, up to 8 days or until revascularization (304). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nAnticoagulation is recommended in support of fibrin-specific therapy to improve vessel patency and prevent reocclusion (336). Dosing of UFH is predicated on the activated partial thromboplastin time, and monitoring of platelet counts to avoid the risks of excess bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is advised (318,337,338,339). UFH may be given as an intravenous bolus and infusion for patients receiving streptokinase if they are at high risk for systemic embolization. Enoxaparin is preferred over UFH for anticoagulation extending beyond 48 hours. Caution is advised when enoxaparin is administered to patients with impaired renal function (340). Fondaparinux should not be given as the sole anticoagulant to patients referred for PCI and is contraindicated for patients with a creatinine clearance \u003c30 mL/min (304,341). Bivalirudin may be used for patients treated with a fibrinolytic agent who develop HIT and require continued anticoagulation (342).\n\nTIMI 3 flow after fibrinolytic therapy predicts subsequent short- and long-term survival (343,344,345). Traditional variables that have been used to assess the angiographic response to fibrinolytic therapy are imprecise (346) and have included an improvement in or relief of chest pain, resolution of ST elevation, and the presence of reperfusion arrhythmias (e.g., accelerated idioventricular rhythm). The relatively sudden and complete relief of chest pain coupled with \u003e70% ST resolution (in the index lead showing the greatest degree of elevation on presentation) is highly suggestive of restoration of normal myocardial blood flow. Complete (or near complete) ST-segment resolution at 60 or 90 minutes after fibrinolytic therapy is a useful marker of a patent infarct artery (347,348,349,350,351). Conversely, partial or absent improvement in the extent of ST elevation is not as accurate in predicting a “closed artery” (349,350,351). Lack of improvement in ST resolution is associated with worse prognosis (349,352,353). The combination of \u003c50% ST resolution and the absence of reperfusion arrhythmias at 2 hours after treatment predicts TIMI flow \u003c3 in the infarct artery with a sensitivity of 81%, specificity 88%, positive predictive value 87%, and negative predictive value 83% (347). Lack of resolution of ST elevation by at least 50% in the worst lead at 60 to 90 minutes should prompt strong consideration of a decision to proceed with immediate coronary angiography and “rescue” PCI.\n\nSee Figure 2.\n\nSee Table 8 for a summary of recommendations from this section; Online Data Supplement 4 for additional data on early catheterization and rescue PCI for fibrinolytic failure in the stent era; and Online Data Supplement 5 for additional data on early catheterization and PCI after fibrinolysis in the stent era.\n\nTable 8Indications for Transfer for Angiography After Fibrinolytic Therapy\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Immediate transfer to a PCI-capable hospital for coronary angiography is recommended for suitable patients with STEMI who develop cardiogenic shock or acute severe HF, irrespective of the time delay from MI onset (354).

Angiography can be performed as soon as logistically feasible at the receiving hospital, and ideally within 24 hours, but should not be performed within the first 2 to 3 hours after administration of fibrinolytic therapy (358,359,360,361,362,363). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nThe SHOCK (Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) trial (354) demonstrated benefit with coronary angiography and emergency revascularization (with either PCI or CABG) compared with immediate medical stabilization and delayed revascularization in patients with ST-elevation/Q-wave or new LBBB MI and cardiogenic shock (Section 9.1.1). Of note, nearly 50% of patients randomized to the emergency revascularization arm received preprocedural fibrinolytic therapy, and the benefit of emergency revascularization was similar for patients transferred versus those admitted directly to a PCI-capable hospital. For patients with cardiogenic shock, the benefit of emergency revascularization was apparent across a very wide time window, extending up to 54 hours after MI and 18 hours after shock onset (354). Although PCI should be performed as soon as possible after MI and shock onset, the time window for benefit in this clinical context is more prolonged because of the ongoing “downward ischemic spiral” associated with shock.\n\nSeveral trials in the stent era and several meta-analyses have examined the role of PCI for fibrinolytic failure (346,355,356,357,364) (Online Data Supplement 4). These studies report a trend toward a lower mortality rate and significantly lower rates of recurrent MI and HF among patients treated with rescue PCI for failed fibrinolysis. For example, in the REACT (Rapid Early Action for Coronary Treatment) study (355), 427 patients who failed to demonstrate evidence of reperfusion at 90 minutes by ECG criteria were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: rescue PCI, conservative care, or repeat fibrinolytic therapy. The primary endpoint, a composite of death, reinfarction, stroke, or severe HF at 6 months, was significantly lower among patients randomized to rescue PCI than among those randomized to conservative care or repeat fibrinolysis (event-free survival rate: 84.6% versus 70.1% versus 68.7%, p=0.004). The benefit was driven primarily by a reduction in reinfarction; there was no significant survival benefit. Minor bleeding was significantly higher among patients randomized to rescue PCI; however, there were no differences in major bleeding among the 3 groups. Other studies have reported higher rates of periprocedural bleeding and stroke in patients undergoing rescue PCI than in patients treated conservatively (346,356). The benefit of transferring a patient for PCI of a persistently occluded infarct artery likely would justify these risks if cardiogenic shock, significant hypotension, severe HF, or ECG evidence of an extensive area of myocardial jeopardy (including an anterior infarction or inferior infarction with either right ventricular [RV] involvement or anterior precordial ST depression) is present. In these circumstances, the benefits are greatest if PCI is initiated early after fibrinolytic failure. On the other hand, conservative treatment might be reasonable in a patient with improving symptoms and a limited inferior infarction despite persistence of ST elevation.\n\nWith the introduction of coronary stents and aggressive antiplatelet therapies, there has been renewed interest in immediate and early catheterization after fibrinolytic therapy. The advantage of this approach is that it can be initiated at non–PCI-capable hospitals and affords the healthcare system additional time to arrange a “nonemergency” transfer for angiography and PCI. Routine referral for angiography with the intent to perform PCI is supported indirectly by retrospective analyses from trials of fibrinolytic therapy that suggest that patients treated with PCI during the index hospitalization have a lower risk of recurrent MI and a lower 2-year mortality rate (365,366,367). The results of RCTs evaluating a strategy of routine catheterization after fibrinolysis are limited by small sample sizes or surrogate endpoints and have provided mixed results. Nevertheless, most trials have demonstrated improvement in clinical outcomes in patients transferred for early catheterization, most notably in higher-risk patients (357,358,359,360,361,362,368,369,370,371) (Table 8 and Figure 3). In the GRACIA (Grup de Analisis de la Cardiopatia Isquemica Aguda) study (362), early catheterization within 6 to 24 hours of successful fibrinolysis in stable patients was compared with an ischemia-guided approach. It resulted in improved outcomes, including a significantly lower rate of death, reinfarction, or ischemia-driven revascularization at 1 year.\n\nFigure 3\n\nPrimary outcome of trials of routine versus ischemia-driven (or delayed) catheterization and PCI after fibrinolytic therapy.

The findings from this and other studies indicate that high-risk patients with STEMI appear to benefit from immediate transfer for early catheterization, compared with either an ischemia-guided approach or delayed routine catheterization at 24 hours to 2 weeks (360,361). The reported benefits relate to a reduction in the incidence of recurrent infarction or ischemia, thus favoring earlier transfer and revascularization when possible.\n\nThe NORDISTEMI (Norwegian Study on District Treatment of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) investigators (358) examined the effect of immediate routine transfer for catheterization versus a conservative strategy with either ischemia-guided treatment in the non–PCI-capable hospital or transfer for rescue PCI. Although this study failed to demonstrate a significant difference between the 2 treatment groups in the incidence of the primary composite endpoint of death, recurrent MI, stroke, or new or recurrent ischemia at 12 months, the incidence of death, recurrent MI, or stroke was significantly lower in the immediate-transfer group. Furthermore, the magnitude of reduction in risk was similar to that reported for high-risk patients in the TRANSFER-AMI study (RR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.87; p=0.004) (360).\n\nIn a meta-analysis (359) that included 7 RCTs of early transfer for catheterization, a strategy of routine early catheterization after fibrinolysis was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of death or MI at 30 days and at 1 year, without an increase in the risk of major bleeding. This meta-analysis was based on a mixture of trials that randomized high-risk patients (360,361,369) and trials that did not mandate the inclusion of high-risk subjects. A meta-regression analysis investigating the relative benefit of an invasive strategy after fibrinolysis according to the baseline risk of the enrolled patients for each trial suggested a larger proportional benefit with early catheterization and PCI in trials enrolling higher-risk patients (359).\n\nIt is important to recognize that the clinical trials that have addressed routine invasive evaluation after initial pharmacological management used a time window of 0 to 24 hours for the “early invasive” strategy, thus supporting earlier transfer after administration of fibrinolytic therapy even for patients without high-risk features. However, this time window likely was used in the trial designs to create the greatest possible difference in outcome when compared with the control group (rather than an a priori expectation that the benefit would be driven entirely in \u003c24 hours). The writing committee believes that there likely will be continued benefit even beyond 24 hours in those patients with a patent but stenotic infarct artery. In stable patients who are not transferred immediately, catheterization can be considered as part of a routine pharmacoinvasive or ischemia-guided approach \u003e24 hours after administration of fibrinolytic therapy. Because of the associated increased bleeding risk, very early (\u003c2 to 3 hours) catheterization after administration of fibrinolytic therapy with intent to perform revascularization should be reserved for patients with evidence of failed fibrinolysis and significant myocardial jeopardy for whom rescue PCI would be appropriate.\nDelayed Invasive Management\n\nSee Table 9 for a summary of recommendations from this section.\n\nTable 9Indications for Coronary Angiography in Patients Who Were Managed With Fibrinolytic Therapy or Who Did Not Receive Reperfusion Therapy\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography with intent to perform revascularization should be performed after STEMI in patients with any of the following:\n        aCardiogenic shock or acute severe HF that develops after initial presentation (215,354,372,373) (Level of Evidence: B);\n        bIntermediate- or high-risk findings on predischarge noninvasive ischemia testing (232,233) (Level of Evidence: B); or\n        cMyocardial ischemia that is spontaneous or provoked by minimal exertion during hospitalization.

(Level of Evidence: B)\n\nThe indications for coronary angiography in patients managed with an initial noninvasive strategy are interwoven with the indications for revascularization (Sections 5.3 and 6.2). Survivors of STEMI with indicators of intermediate or high risk and those with recurrent ischemia or mechanical complications should be considered for coronary angiography and revascularization. In addition, when STEMI is suspected to have occurred by a mechanism other than thrombotic occlusion at the site of an atherosclerotic plaque, coronary angiography may be reasonable to provide diagnostic information and to direct specific therapy. Routine referral for angiography of patients after fibrinolytic therapy is discussed in Section 5.3. Coronary angiography in patients with evidence of failed reperfusion or reocclusion should be performed as soon as logistically feasible (346,355).\n\nSee Table 10 for a summary of recommendations from this section.\n\nTable 10Indications for PCI of an Infarct Artery in Patients Who Were Managed With Fibrinolytic Therapy or Who Did Not Receive Reperfusion Therapy\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1PCI of an anatomically significant stenosis in the infarct artery should be performed in patients with suitable anatomy and any of the following:\n        aCardiogenic shock or acute severe HF (354) (Level of Evidence: B);\n        bIntermediate- or high-risk findings on predischarge noninvasive ischemia testing (232,233) (Level of Evidence: C); or\n        cMyocardial ischemia that is spontaneous or provoked by minimal exertion during hospitalization.

PCI can be performed as soon as logistically feasible at the receiving hospital, and ideally within 24 hours, but should not be performed within the first 2 to 3 hours after administration of fibrinolytic therapy (358,359,360,361,362,363). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIb\n\n    1Delayed PCI of a significant stenosis in a patent infarct artery greater than 24 hours after STEMI may be considered as part of an invasive strategy in stable§ patients (213,232,233,366,374,375,376,377,378). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS III: NO BENEFIT\n\n    1Delayed PCI of a totally occluded infarct artery greater than 24 hours after STEMI should not be performed in asymptomatic patients with 1- or 2-vessel disease if they are hemodynamically and electrically stable and do not have evidence of severe ischemia (213,376). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nDelayed PCI of the infarct artery is performed in patients treated with an initial noninvasive strategy (i.e., with fibrinolysis or without reperfusion therapy) who become unstable because of the development of cardiogenic shock, acute severe HF, or unstable postinfarction angina, provided that invasive management is not considered futile or inappropriate (215,379). Delayed PCI also encompasses interventions performed for fibrinolytic failure (355,356) or infarct artery reocclusion, as part of an invasive strategy for patients after successful fibrinolysis (359,360,361), and for patients who did not receive reperfusion therapy but who did demonstrate significant residual ischemia during hospitalization. The benefits of routine, i.e., non–ischemia-driven, PCI of an angiographically significant stenosis in a patent infarct artery \u003e24 hours after STEMI are less well established (232,233,378). Delayed PCI of a totally occluded infarct artery \u003e24 hours after STEMI should not be undertaken in clinically stable patients without evidence of severe ischemia. In OAT (Occluded Artery Trial), there was no difference in the composite endpoint of death, reinfarction, or class IV HF at a median follow-up of 5.8 years between patients managed with PCI and those treated medically. Reinfarction rates tended to be higher in the PCI group (380).\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1PCI is indicated in a noninfarct artery at a time separate from primary PCI in patients who have spontaneous symptoms of myocardial ischemia. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1PCI is reasonable in a noninfarct artery at a time separate from primary PCI in patients with intermediate- or high-risk findings on noninvasive testing (216,232,233). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nMultivessel coronary artery disease is present in 40% to 65% of patients presenting with STEMI who undergo primary PCI and is associated with adverse prognosis (381,382). Studies of staged PCI of noninfarct arteries have been nonrandomized in design and have varied with regard to the timing of PCI and duration of follow-up. These variations have contributed to the disparate findings reported, although there seems to be a clear trend toward lower rates of adverse outcomes when primary PCI is limited to the infarct artery and PCI of a noninfarct artery is undertaken in staged fashion at a later time (216,224,225,383,384). The largest of these observational studies compared 538 patients undergoing staged multivessel PCI within 60 days of primary PCI with propensity-matched individuals who had culprit-vessel PCI alone (216). Multivessel PCI was associated with a lower mortality rate at 1 year (1.3% versus 3.3%; p=0.04). A nonsignificant trend toward a lower mortality rate at 1 year was observed in the subset of 258 patients who underwent staged PCI during the initial hospitalization for STEMI (216). Although fractional flow reserve is evaluated infrequently in patients with STEMI, at least 1 study suggests that determination of fractional flow reserve may be useful to assess the hemodynamic significance of potential target lesions in noninfarct arteries (385). The writing committee encourages research into the benefit of PCI of noninfarct arteries in patients with multivessel disease after successful primary PCI (Section 12.6).\n\nSee Table 11 for a summary of recommendations from this section.\n\nTable 11Adjunctive Antithrombotic Therapy to Support PCI After Fibrinolytic Therapy\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nThe selection of adjunctive antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies for use during PCI after fibrinolytic therapy should take into account the fibrinolytic agent used, the time since its administration, and the antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents already administered. GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors should be used with great caution, if at all, after full-dose fibrinolytic therapy, because this combination is associated with high rates of bleeding and ICH, particularly in the elderly (386,387,388,389).\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1After PCI, aspirin should be continued indefinitely (253,254,257,259,330,331).

(Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1After PCI, it is reasonable to use 81 mg of aspirin per day in preference to higher maintenance doses (253,259,263,264). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2Prasugrel, in a 60-mg loading dose, is reasonable once the coronary anatomy is known in patients who did not receive a previous loading dose of clopidogrel at the time of administration of a fibrinolytic agent, but prasugrel should not be given sooner than 24 hours after administration of a fibrin-specific agent or 48 hours after administration of a non–fibrin-specific agent (260,262). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    3Prasugrel, in a 10-mg daily maintenance dose, is reasonable after PCI (260,262). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS III: HARM\n\n    1Prasugrel should not be administered to patients with a history of prior stroke or transient ischemic attack (260). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nPatients with STEMI should receive clopidogrel at the time of administration of a fibrinolytic agent as a routine part of a pharmacological reperfusion strategy (Section 5.1). Clopidogrel then should be continued in uninterrupted fashion through and after PCI. The optimal loading dose of clopidogrel before or at the time of PCI in patients who may not have received it previously with fibrinolytic therapy is not known. In the CLARITY-TIMI 28 (Clopidogrel as Adjunctive Reperfusion Therapy—Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 28) trial (331), PCI was performed 2 to 8 days after fibrinolysis in about half of the enrolled patients, and open-label clopidogrel (300-mg loading dose, 75-mg maintenance dose) was administered after diagnostic angiography in patients undergoing infarct artery stenting. Treatment with clopidogrel significantly reduced the incidence of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (major secondary composite endpoint) after PCI. In addition, there was no significant increase in the rates of TIMI major or minor bleeding with clopidogrel treatment. A subset of patients with STEMI in the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial received fibrinolytic therapy \u003e24 hours (for fibrin-specific agents) or \u003e48 hours (for non–fibrin-specific agents) before PCI. In this subset, the use of prasugrel compared to clopidogrel was associated with a significantly lower rate of the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.54 to 0.87; p=0.0017), and a similar rate of TIMI major bleeding unrelated to CABG (262). Accordingly, prasugrel (60-mg loading dose) may be used as an alternative to clopidogrel in patients with STEMI who undergo delayed PCI after administration of a fibrinolytic agent.\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1For patients with STEMI undergoing PCI after receiving fibrinolytic therapy with intravenous UFH, additional boluses of intravenous UFH should be administered as needed to support the procedure, taking into account whether GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists have been administered. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    2For patients with STEMI undergoing PCI after receiving fibrinolytic therapy with enoxaparin, if the last subcutaneous dose was administered within the prior 8 hours, no additional enoxaparin should be given; if the last subcutaneous dose was administered between 8 and 12 hours earlier, enoxaparin 0.3 mg/kg IV should be given (335,390). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS III: HARM\n\n    1Fondaparinux should not be used as the sole anticoagulant to support PCI. An additional anticoagulant with anti-IIa activity should be administered because of the risk of catheter thrombosis (304). (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nAnticoagulation should be continued through emergent or nonurgent PCI procedures performed during the index hospitalization after initial use of fibrinolytic therapy. For patients who received UFH or enoxaparin with fibrinolytic therapy, these agents may be continued uninterrupted through the PCI procedure (390). Transitioning from enoxaparin to either UFH or bivalirudin is possible, provided the last enoxaparin dose was \u003e12 hours before PCI. Similarly, UFH may be transitioned to bivalirudin for PCI. Fondaparinux does not provide adequate anticoagulation for PCI, and additional intravenous boluses of UFH (or bivalirudin) should be administered (304).\nCoronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Urgent CABG is indicated in patients with STEMI and coronary anatomy not amenable to PCI who have ongoing or recurrent ischemia, cardiogenic shock, severe HF, or other high-risk features (391,392,393).

(Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCABG has a limited role in the acute phase of STEMI other than for cardiogenic shock, but it may be indicated for failed PCI, for coronary anatomy not amenable to PCI, and at the time of surgical repair of a mechanical defect, such as ventricular septal, papillary muscle, or free-wall rupture. Older case series highlighted a potential excess mortality risk for CABG when performed early after STEMI, which was related to worsening myocardial injury from cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic cross-clamping, and cardioplegic arrest, with hemorrhagic transformation and infarct expansion. However, contemporary modifications to the standard operative approach, such as on-pump beating-heart surgery, off-pump techniques, or adjunctive temporary mechanical circulatory support devices, may lead to improved survival rates after CABG in the acute hospital phase.\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Aspirin should not be withheld before urgent CABG (399). (Level of Evidence: C)\n    2Clopidogrel or ticagrelor should be discontinued at least 24 hours before urgent on-pump CABG, if possible (400,401,402,403,404). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    3Short-acting intravenous GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists (eptifibatide, tirofiban) should be discontinued at least 2 to 4 hours before urgent CABG (405,406). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    4Abciximab should be discontinued at least 12 hours before urgent CABG (362). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIb\n\n    1Urgent off-pump CABG within 24 hours of clopidogrel or ticagrelor administration might be considered, especially if the benefits of prompt revascularization outweigh the risks of bleeding (401,407,408,409). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2Urgent CABG within 5 days of clopidogrel or ticagrelor administration or within 7 days of prasugrel administration might be considered, especially if the benefits of prompt revascularization outweigh the risks of bleeding. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nIn contrast to previous observations (410,411,412) of markedly increased rates of major bleeding and mediastinal reexploration after CABG in patients exposed to clopidogrel within 5 to 7 days before CABG, several reports have suggested that it might be reasonable to proceed with urgent surgery within a shorter time frame, especially when the benefits of revascularization outweigh the risks of bleeding, as often may be the case among patients with ACS (402,404). Shorter delays to urgent surgery may also be possible when off-pump revascularization is planned. Among the 136 patients in CLARITY-TIMI 28 who underwent CABG within 5 days of clopidogrel exposure, there was no difference in the rates of major bleeding through 30 days of follow-up between the clopidogrel and placebo groups (7.5% versus 7.2%, respectively; p=1.00) (331). In a prospective RCT examining the effect of the timing of clopidogrel discontinuation before CABG, 3 groups were studied: clopidogrel continued to the day of surgery, clopidogrel discontinued 3 days before surgery, and clopidogrel discontinued 5 days before surgery. Patients in the continuation group experienced increased rates of bleeding and blood product utilization, but the 3- and 5-day discontinuation groups had comparably low bleeding rates and blood product usage that resembled historical control values (413). In a retrospective analysis of a nonrandomized subgroup of patients in the PLATO trial, in which several definitions of bleeding were used, no significant differences in CABG-related bleeding were observed between patients allocated ticagrelor and patients who received clopidogrel, and there were no observed differences in the rates of reoperation (401). In contrast, among the relatively few patients with STEMI in TRITON-TIMI 38 who underwent CABG during the 15-month course of the study, rates of TIMI major or minor bleeding after CABG were significantly higher with prasugrel than with clopidogrel (21.9% versus 4.1%; OR: 6.53; 95% CI: 1.78 to 23.94; p=0.0032) (262). The excess bleeding hazard observed with prasugrel should prompt consideration of an alternative antiplatelet strategy in patients with STEMI who may require urgent CABG during their index hospitalization. The timing of elective CABG in relation to the use of P2Y12 receptor antagonists is referenced in Section 4.1 of the 2011 ACCF/AHA Guideline for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery (393).\nRoutine Medical Therapies\n\nSee Table 12 for a summary of selected routine medical therapies.\n\nTable 12Selected Routine Medical Therapies\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Oral beta blockers should be initiated in the first 24 hours in patients with STEMI who do not have any of the following: signs of HF, evidence of a low output state, increased risk for cardiogenic shock,∥\n\n    ∥ ∥Risk factors for cardiogenic shock (the greater the number of risk factors present, the higher the risk of developing cardiogenic shock) are age \u003e70 years, systolic BP \u003c120 mm Hg, sinus tachycardia \u003e110 bpm or heart rate \u003c60 bpm, and increased time since onset of symptoms of STEMI.\n    or other contraindications to use of oral beta blockers (PR interval more than 0.24 seconds, second- or third-degree heart block, active asthma, or reactive airways disease) (414,415,416). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2Beta blockers should be continued during and after hospitalization for all patients with STEMI and with no contraindications to their use (417,418). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    3Patients with initial contraindications to the use of beta blockers in the first 24 hours after STEMI should be reevaluated to determine their subsequent eligibility. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1It is reasonable to administer intravenous beta blockers at the time of presentation to patients with STEMI and no contraindications to their use who are hypertensive or have ongoing ischemia (414,415,416). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nThe efficacy and safety of the early routine use of intravenous beta blockers were examined in COMMIT/CCS-2 (Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial) (414). Early intravenous metoprolol followed by high-dose oral therapy had a neutral effect on the combined endpoint of death, recurrent MI, or cardiac arrest. There were lower rates of recurrent MI and VF in the treated group, outcomes that were balanced by a significantly higher rate of cardiogenic shock with metoprolol, especially on days 0 and 1. The likelihood of developing cardiogenic shock was increased in certain subgroups, including patients with age \u003e70 years, systolic BP \u003c120 mm Hg, presenting heart rate \u003e110 bpm, or increased time since onset of symptoms of STEMI. The benefit of beta blockers for secondary prevention has been established in numerous trials conducted in the prereperfusion era and appears to be greatest for patients with MI complicated by HF, LV dysfunction, or ventricular arrhyth mias (418). The long-term duration of routine beta-blocker therapy after uncomplicated MI in patients without HF or hypertension has not been prospectively addressed. AHA/ACCF secondary prevention guidelines recommend a 3-year treatment course in this patient subset (257).\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor should be administered within the first 24 hours to all patients with STEMI with anterior location, HF, or ejection fraction (EF) less than or equal to 0.40, unless contraindicated (420,421,422,423). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    2An angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) should be given to patients with STEMI who have indications for but are intolerant of ACE inhibitors (424,425). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    3An aldosterone antagonist should be given to patients with STEMI and no contraindications who are already receiving an ACE inhibitor and beta blocker and who have an EF less than or equal to 0.40 and either symptomatic HF or diabetes mellitus (426). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1ACE inhibitors are reasonable for all patients with STEMI and no contraindications to their use (427,428,429). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\nOral ACE inhibitors reduce fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events in patients with STEMI (360,361,420,422,428,429,430). Their protective effects have been demonstrated independent of the use of other pharmacotherapies (i.e., fibrinolytics, aspirin, and beta blockers). The magnitude of clinical benefit is greatest in high-risk patient subgroups (i.e., anterior MI, EF ≤0.40, HF, prior MI, and tachycardia) (431). Demonstration of an early benefit (within the first 24 hours) supports the prompt use of these agents in patients without existing contraindications (hypotension, shock, bilateral renal artery stenosis or history of worsening of renal function with ACE inhibitor/ARB exposure, renal failure, or drug allergy). The role of routine long-term ACE inhibitor therapy in low-risk patients after STEMI who have been revascularized and treated with aggressive lipid-lowering therapies is less certain (432). ARBs are indicated for ACE inhibitor–intolerant patients. Specifically, valsartan was found to be noninferior to captopril in the VALIANT (Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial (424).\n\nThe EPHESUS (Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure Efficacy and Survival) study established the benefit of an aldosterone antagonist, eplerenone, added to optimal medical therapy in eligible patients (creatinine ≤2.5 mg/dL in men and ≤2.0 mg/dL in women, potassium ≤5.0 mEq/L) 3 to 14 days after STEMI with EF ≤0.40 and either symptomatic HF or diabetes mellitus (426). A post hoc analysis of the EPHESUS trial suggested a time-dependent treatment effect of eplerenone. Earlier initiation of the drug (\u003c7 days) significantly reduced the rates of all-cause mortality, sudden cardiac death (SCD), and cardiovascular mortality/hospitalization, whereas initiation ≥7 days had no significant effect on outcomes (433).\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued in all patients with STEMI and no contraindications to its use (434,435,436). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1It is reasonable to obtain a fasting lipid profile in patients with STEMI, preferably within 24 hours of presentation. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nTreatment with statins in patients stabilized after an ACS, including STEMI, lowers the risk of coronary heart disease death, recurrent MI, stroke, and the need for coronary revascularization (437,438). More intensive statin therapy, compared with less intensive therapy, appears to be associated with an additional lowering of nonfatal clinical endpoints (434,436,439). Among currently available statins, only high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg daily) has been shown to reduce death and ischemic events among patients with ACS (436,440). Approximately one third of patients in the PROVE-IT TIMI 22 (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy—Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22) trial had STEMI (436). Cardiovascular event rates were not significantly reduced with a tiered strategy of simvastatin (40-mg daily for 1 month followed by 80 mg daily) in the A to Z Trial (Aggrastat to Zocor) (439), and concerns have been raised recently about the safety of high-dose simvastatin (i.e., 80 mg daily) (441). Although the benefit of high-intensity statins declines among statin-naïve patients with ACS as a function of decreasing low-density lipoprotein levels (442), the writing committee recommends the use of statins in all patients with STEMI (435). Statin therapy after ACS is beneficial even in patients with baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels \u003c70 mg/dL (443). Trials of statin therapy in patients with ACS and stable ischemic heart disease have been designed to compare either more intensive versus less intensive statin treatment or active statin versus placebo (434,435,436,437,438,439,440). They have not been designed to compare clinical outcomes as a function of the specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level achieved with treatment. Improved compliance with therapy is a strong rationale for timing the initiation of lipid-lowering drug therapy before discharge after STEMI. Longer-term lipid management after STEMI, including indications for targeting triglycerides and non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are addressed in the “AHA/ACC Secondary Prevention and Risk Reduction Therapy for Patients With Coronary and Other Vascular Disease: 2011 Update” (257).\n\nAlthough nitroglycerin can ameliorate symptoms and signs of myocardial ischemia by reducing LV preload and increasing coronary blood flow, it generally does not attenuate the myocardial injury associated with epicardial coronary artery occlusion unless vasospasm plays a significant role. Intravenous nitroglycerin may be useful to treat patients with STEMI and hypertension or HF. Nitrates should not be given to patients with hypotension, marked bradycardia or tachycardia, RV infarction, or 5′phosphodiesterase inhibitor use within the previous 24 to 48 hours (444). There is no role for the routine use of oral nitrates in the convalescent phase of STEMI.\n\nAn overview of 28 RCTs involving 19,000 patients demonstrated no beneficial effect on infarct size or the rate of reinfarction when calcium channel blocker therapy was initiated during either the acute or convalescent phase of STEMI (445). Calcium channel blockers may be useful, however, to relieve ischemia, lower BP, or control the ventricular response rate to atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients who are intolerant of beta blockers. Caution is advised in patients with LV systolic dysfunction. The use of the immediate-release nifedipine is contraindicated in patients with STEMI because of hypotension and reflex sympathetic activation with tachycardia (446).\n\nFew data exist to support or refute the value of the routine use of oxygen in the acute phase of STEMI, and more research is needed. A pooled Cochrane analysis of 3 trials showed a 3-fold higher risk of death for patients with confirmed acute MI treated with oxygen than for patients with acute MI managed on room air. Oxygen therapy is appropriate for patients who are hypoxemic (oxygen saturation \u003c90%) and may have a salutary placebo effect in others. Supplementary oxygen may, however, increase coronary vascular resistance (447). Oxygen should be administered with caution to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and carbon dioxide retention.\n\nIn the absence of a history of hypersensitivity, morphine sulfate is the drug of choice for pain relief in patients with STEMI, especially those whose course is complicated by acute pulmonary edema. It can alleviate the work of breathing, reduce anxiety, and favorably affect ventricular loading conditions. The dose of morphine sulfate needed to achieve adequate pain control will vary depending on patient age, body size, BP, and heart rate. Naloxone can be administered in doses of 0.1 to 0.2 mg IV every 15 minutes when indicated to reverse the narcotic effects of morphine, and atropine 0.5 to 1.5 mg IV may be administered to counter excessive morphine-related bradycardia.\n\nEpidemiological studies and retrospective analyses of RCTs have suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective cyclooxygenase II enzyme (COX-2) inhibitors may be associated with an increased risk of death, reinfarction, cardiac rupture, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and HF (448,449,450,451). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with STEMI. They should not be initiated in the acute phase and should be discontinued in patients using them before hospitalization.\nComplications After STEMI\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Emergency revascularization with either PCI or CABG is recommended in suitable patients with cardiogenic shock due to pump failure after STEMI irrespective of the time delay from MI onset (212,379,452). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2In the absence of contraindications, fibrinolytic therapy should be administered to patients with STEMI and cardiogenic shock who are unsuitable candidates for either PCI or CABG (81,453,454). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1The use of intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) counterpulsation can be useful for patients with cardiogenic shock after STEMI who do not quickly stabilize with pharmacological therapy (455,456,457,458,459). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIb\n\n    1Alternative LV assist devices for circulatory support may be considered in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCardiogenic shock in patients with STEMI may be caused by extensive LV infarction or by mechanical complications, including papillary muscle rupture, ventricular septal rupture, free-wall rupture with tamponade, and RV infarction. The onset of cardiogenic shock due to mechanical complications after STEMI is bimodal; most cases occur within 24 hours. For those with pump failure, 15% of cases occur at time of presentation, and 85% develop during hospitalization. Revascularization with timely PCI or CABG is the preferred reperfusion strategy for patients with STEMI and shock due to pump failure, irrespective of the time delay. Shock or severe HF is perhaps the only clinical scenario in which acute revascularization of significant stenoses in noninfarct arteries can be justified. In the SHOCK trial, mortality rates at 6 and 12 months were significantly lower in patients allocated to emergency revascularization than in patients who received immediate medical stabilization (212,354). Nearly two thirds of the patients in the medical stabilization group received fibrinolytic therapy, and 25% underwent delayed revascularization. IABP support was used in 86% of both groups. Although the trial did not show benefit with emergency revascularization for the prespecified age group \u003e75 years, the small number of patients in the trial did not allow for firm conclusions to be drawn about management. Elderly patients offered emergency revascularization in the nonrandomized SHOCK registry had a substantial adjusted survival benefit with emergency revascularization compared with delayed or no revascularization (460). Similar findings in favor of early revascularization for selected elderly patients were reported from 2 additional registries (461,462). Although age alone is not a contraindication to emergency revascularization in this setting, individual judgment based on comorbidities, functional status, and patient directives is necessary in the elderly. Triage and immediate transfer to a PCI-capable facility with on-site cardiac surgical backup are indicated for patients with STEMI complicated by shock. Fibrinolytic therapy is reserved for patients without contraindications within 24 hours of MI for whom revascularization is considered not feasible for technical, anatomic, or patient-related issues. The need for hemodynamic support with inotropic therapy, IABP, or both should be assessed on an individual basis. Observational data on the usefulness of IABP in this setting are conflicting. A meta-analysis supports IABP therapy as an adjunct to fibrinolysis but not to primary PCI (458). Compared with IABP, LV assist devices may provide superior hemodynamic support and serve as more effective bridges to recovery or transplantation, though experience with their use in this setting is limited (463,464). Medical support with inotropes and vasopressor agents should be individualized and guided by invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Use of dopamine in this setting may be associated with excess hazard (465).\n\nThe development of HF after STEMI is an indication for angiography with intent to proceed with revascularization if not previously performed. LV myocardium may be ischemic, stunned, hibernating, or irrevocably injured, and viability assessment may be needed depending on the timing of revascularization. Ischemic (functional) mitral regurgitation due to LV remodeling may coexist, progress over time, and require surgical attention depending on its severity. Medical treatment is based on the use of diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropic agents when required. Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system should be provided as tolerated, and the indications for beta-blocker therapy should be evaluated continuously throughout the hospital course.\n\nRV infarction complicates the course of approximately one third of patients with inferior STEMI, is most often due to proximal occlusion of the right coronary artery, and is associated with a higher mortality risk. Evidence of RV involvement should be sought in all patients with inferior STEMI. The clinical triad of hypotension, clear lung fields, and elevated jugular venous pressure is characteristic. Demonstration of 1-mm ST elevation in lead V1 and in right precordial lead V4R is the most sensitive ECG marker of RV injury (466). Transthoracic echocardiography can be helpful in patients with initially nondiagnostic findings (467). Treatment includes maintenance of RV preload, reduction of RV afterload, inotropic support if needed, and immediate reperfusion (468,469). Nitrates and diuretics should be avoided. Restoration of atrioventricular (AV) synchrony or cardioversion from AF may be needed.\n\nMechanical complications after STEMI have a bimodal, temporal distribution: Most occur in the first 24 hours, and the remainder present within the first week. The presence of a new systolic murmur indicates the possibility of either ventricle septal rupture or mitral regurgitation. Diagnosis usually can be established with transthoracic echocardiography. Surgical consultation should be obtained when a mechanical defect is suspected. Prompt repair (with or without CABG) is indicated in most cases. IABP can provide temporary circulatory support.\n\nMitral regurgitation after STEMI occurs via 1 of 2 mechanisms: papillary muscle rupture or postinfarction LV remodeling with displacement of the papillary muscles, leaflet tethering, and annular dilatation. Acute rupture affects the posteromedial papillary muscle more often than anterolateral papillary muscle because of its singular blood supply (470,471). Acute severe mitral regurgitation is characterized by pulmonary edema and/or shock; a systolic murmur may not always be appreciated. Suitable patients with papillary muscle rupture should be considered for urgent surgery while temporary stabilization with medical therapy and IABP is attempted. Mitral valve replacement rather than repair usually is required in this setting. Although emergency mitral valve replacement is associated with a relatively high mortality rate (20%), survival and ventricular function are improved with surgery compared with medical therapy alone. Delay to operation appears to increase the risk of further myocardial injury, organ failure, and death (472). Five-year survival rates after surgery average 60% to 70% (397,473,474,475,476).\n\nWith ischemic (functional) mitral regurgitation, treatment is focused on timely reperfusion, diuretics, and afterload reduction. The severity of mitral regurgitation may improve in some patients with aggressive medical treatment, PCI, or both. The rate of long-term survival after STEMI declines as a function of residual mitral regurgitation severity. If surgery is required during the index hospitalization because of ongoing ischemia or HF, mitral valve repair with a downsized annuloplasty ring usually is performed, though valve replacement may be preferred in many cases. In this regard, management of ischemic mitral regurgitation differs importantly from that of myxomatous mitral regurgitation.\n\nVentricular septal rupture usually is heralded by a loud systolic murmur and HF or shock, depending on the size of the defect and the degree of RV and LV dysfunction. Data from the GUSTO-1 (The Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) trial and the SHOCK registry indicate that ventricular septal rupture occurs most often within the first 24 hours in patients with STEMI treated with fibrinolytic therapy (477,478). Emergency surgical repair is necessary, even in hemodynamically stable patients (479,480,481), because the rupture site can expand abruptly, resulting in sudden hemodynamic collapse in previously stable patients (481). Temporizing medical treatment consists of inotropic and vasodilator agents, with IABP when needed. The surgical mortality rate remains high, especially among patients with shock, ranging from 20% to 87% in reported series (395,477,478,479,480,482,483). Mortality risk is higher for patients with inferior-basal defects than for those with anterior-apical defects. Percutaneous closure is a less invasive option that might allow for initial hemodynamic stabilization, but experience with this approach is limited, and residual shunts are common. Further technical developments and prospective trials are required to identify patients best suited for transcatheter closure.\n\nFree-wall rupture is characterized by recurrent chest pain and ST-T-wave changes, with rapid progression to hemodynamic collapse, electromechanical dissociation, and death (484). It is observed most frequently in patients with first MI, anterior infarction, the elderly, and women. Other risk factors include hypertension during the acute phase of STEMI, lack of antecedent angina or prior MI, absence of collateral blood flow, Q waves on ECG, use of corticosteroids or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and administration of fibrinolytic therapy \u003e14 hours after symptom onset (485,486). Pseudoaneurysm formation with contained rupture and tamponade can be recognized with transthoracic echocardiography, and emergency surgery should be considered. Most case series of patients reaching the operating room for management of this complication are of small size, with mortality rates approaching 60% (396,487).\n\nVentricular aneurysm formation after STEMI occurs in \u003c5% of patients and is more frequent in those with anterior infarction. Incidence rates have declined with timely reperfusion. Surgery for LV aneurysm after STEMI is rarely needed but may be considered for treatment of HF, ventricular arrhythmias not amenable to drugs or radiofrequency ablation, or recurrent thromboembolism despite appropriate anticoagulant therapy.\n\nVentricular arrhythmias are common early after onset of STEMI, and not all require intervention. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with STEMI is most often due to lethal ventricular arrhythmias, including sustained VT and VF (Section 3.6.1). The mechanisms for these arrhythmias are multifactorial and include ongoing ischemia, hemodynamic and electrolyte abnormalities, reentry, and enhanced automaticity. As many as 10% of hospitalized patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy in the GUSTO-I trial had sustained VT/VF complicating their course (488). An analysis of patients referred for primary PCI in the APEX-AMI (Assessment of Pexelizumab in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial reported a lower incidence of sustained VT/VF (5.7%); 90% of cases occurred within 48 hours of presentation (489). Compared with patients without VT/VF, 90-day mortality risk was 2-fold higher for patients with early VT/VF (i.e., before the completion of primary PCI) and 5-fold higher for patients with late VT/VF (i.e., after primary PCI). Several factors were associated with the occurrence of both early and late VT/VF, including HF, hypotension, tachycardia, shock, and TIMI flow grade. Treatment consists of immediate defibrillation or cardioversion for VF or pulseless sustained VT, respectively, and antiarrhythmic drug therapy in accordance with the 2010 Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines for sustained VT with a pulse (490). Prevention of VT/VF is directed to correction of electrolyte and acid/base abnormalities, optimization of myocardial perfusion, eradication of ongoing ischemia, and treatment of associated complications such as HF or shock. Early (within 24 hours of presentation) administration of beta blockers has been associated with a reduction in the incidence of VF (414,489) and is recommended for all patients without contraindications (Section 8.1). The prophylactic use of lidocaine is not recommended. Premature ventricular complexes, nonsustained VT not associated with hemodynamic compromise, and accelerated idioventricular rhythms that emerge after reperfusion are not indicative of increased SCD risk and do not require specific therapy in the acute phase of STEMI.\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy is indicated before discharge in patients who develop sustained VT/VF more than 48 hours after STEMI, provided the arrhythmia is not due to transient or reversible ischemia, reinfarction, or metabolic abnormalities (491,492,493). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nLife-threatening ventricular arrhythmias that occur \u003e48 hours after STEMI usually are associated with significant LV systolic dysfunction and signify poor prognosis. Although previous RCTs (492,494,495) have not specifically addressed this population of patients with STEMI, they have shown clear and consistent benefit of ICD therapy for survivors of sustained VT or VF arrest (493). In the absence of a reversible cause, late (\u003e48 hours) in-hospital sustained VT/VF is an indication for ICD therapy for secondary prevention of SCD. For other at-risk patients, particularly those with significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), candidacy for ICD therapy for primary prevention of SCD should be reassessed at ≥40 days after discharge (Section 10.3). See the “2008 ACCF/AHA/HRS Guidelines for Device-Based Therapy of Cardiac Rhythm Abnormalities” (496).\n\nAF, atrial flutter, and other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias occur frequently in patients with STEMI and are triggered by excessive sympathetic stimulation, atrial stretch due to LV or RV volume/pressure overload, atrial infarction, pericarditis, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia, or underlying lung disease. By far the most common supraventricular arrhythmia is AF, which occurs in 8% to 22% of patients with STEMI, with higher rates in elderly patients and those with HF and hypertension. In a contemporary study, the incidence of new-onset AF during hospitalization was 6.3% (497). New-onset AF was significantly associated with shock, HF, stroke, and 90-day mortality (497). These observations mirrored those seen in earlier trials (317,422,428,497,498,499). The cumulative incidence of AF among MI survivors with EF ≤0.40 over approximately 2 years of follow-up approaches 30% (500).\n\nManagement of AF during hospitalization for STEMI is based on the usual considerations of rhythm versus rate control and the indications for anticoagulation according to current guidelines (501,502). For hemodynamically unstable patients or those with ongoing ischemic symptoms, treatment should be implemented according to the 2010 Advanced Cardiac Life Support guideline for management of unstable supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (490). If medical treatment is unsuccessful, synchronized, direct current cardioversion may be indicated. Provision of anticoagulation in the context of DAPT creates additional challenges related to the risk of bleeding (Section 9.7).\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Temporary pacing is indicated for symptomatic bradyarrhythmias unresponsive to medical treatment. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nSinus bradycardia is common early after STEMI, particularly with inferior location. It is mediated through increased vagal tone, is usually self-limited, and generally requires no treatment. It may be necessary to withhold beta blockers until the bradycardia resolves. Symptomatic or hemodynamically important sinus bradycardia should be treated with atropine or temporary pacing if not responsive (504).\n\nThe development of AV block and intraventricular conduction delays is associated with the extent of infarction. The incidence of abnormal conduction has decreased substantially in the reperfusion era. In a survey of nearly 3 million hospital discharges after MI from 1996 to 2003, the incidence of complete heart block was 3.7% in inferior/posterior MI and 1.0% in anterior/lateral MI (505). AV block of varying degree and persistent bundle-branch block develop in approximately 7% and 5% of patients with STEMI, respectively (506,507). High-grade (i.e., second- or third-degree) AV block and persistent bundle-branch block are independently associated with worse short- and long-term prognosis in both inferior/posterior and anterior/lateral MI but are more ominous in anterior/lateral MI because of a relatively greater extent of myocardial injury (506,507,508).\n\nFirst-degree AV block does not require treatment. High-grade AV block with inferior/posterior STEMI usually is transient and associated with a narrow complex/junctional escape rhythm that can be managed conservatively. Application of transcutaneous pacing pads for potential use is reasonable. Prophylactic placement of a temporary pacing system is recommended for high-grade AV block and/or new bundle-branch (especially LBBB) or bifascicular block in patients with anterior/lateral MI. Choice of pacing system (transcutaneous versus transvenous) varies across institutions. Indications for permanent pacing for persistent AV block or bundle-branch block after STEMI are reviewed in the 2008 ACC/AHA/HRS device-based therapy guidelines (496).\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Aspirin is recommended for treatment of pericarditis after STEMI (509). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIb\n\n    1Administration of acetaminophen, colchicine, or narcotic analgesics may be reasonable if aspirin, even in higher doses, is not effective. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCLASS III: HARM\n\n    1Glucocorticoids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are potentially harmful for treatment of pericarditis after STEMI (510,511). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nThe incidence of acute pericarditis after STEMI has decreased with the aggressive use of reperfusion therapy (512,513). Pericarditis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of recurrent chest pain after STEMI, particularly when the discomfort is pleuritic or positional, radiates to the trapezius ridge, and is associated with a pericardial friction rub. Recurrent or worsening ST elevation without early T-wave inversion may be present. Distinction from reinfarction or acute stent thrombosis is crucial. In rare circumstances, if pain is persistent (\u003e1 week) and accompanied by systemic features of malaise, fever, and increased inflammatory biomarkers, Dressler syndrome should be considered. In most cases, the pain is self-limited and responds to conservative measures. The use of colchicine has been extrapolated from its efficacy in other settings. Although pericarditis is not an absolute contraindication to anticoagulation (514), caution should be exercised because of the potential for hemorrhagic conversion (515).\n\nAsymptomatic pericardial effusions are common after STEMI (516,517). It is important to exclude free-wall rupture when a pericardial effusion is present (518,519), especially if the width of the effusion is \u003e1 cm (520). When tamponade is present, free-wall rupture, hemorrhagic conversion, or aortic dissection should be considered. Anticoagulation should be discontinued in the presence of a significant (≥1 cm) or enlarging pericardial effusion.\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist should be provided to patients with STEMI and AF with CHADS2 score#\n\n    # #CHADS2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥75 years, Diabetes mellitus, previous Stroke/transient ischemic attack [doubled risk weight]) score.\n    greater than or equal to 2, mechanical heart valves, venous thromboembolism, or hypercoagulable disorder. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    2The duration of triple antithrombotic therapy with a vitamin K antagonist, aspirin, and a P2Y12receptor inhibitor should be minimized to the extent possible to limit the risk of bleeding.⁎⁎\n\n    ⁎⁎ ⁎⁎Individual circumstances will vary and depend on the indications for triple therapy and the type of stent placed during PCI. After this initial treatment period, consider therapy with a vitamin K antagonist plus a single antiplatelet agent. For patients treated with fibrinolysis, consider triple therapy for 14 days, followed by a vitamin K antagonist plus a single antiplatelet agent (522,523,524,525).\n    (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCLASS IIa\n\n    1Anticoagulant therapy with a vitamin K antagonist is reasonable for patients with STEMI and asymptomatic LV mural thrombi. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCLASS IIb\n\n    1Anticoagulant therapy may be considered for patients with STEMI and anterior apical akinesis or dyskinesis. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    2Targeting vitamin K antagonist therapy to a lower international normalized ratio (e.g., 2.0 to 2.5) might be considered in patients with STEMI who are receiving DAPT. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nPrevious recommendations for the use of vitamin K antagonists, either alone or in combination with low-dose aspirin, for secondary prevention or for reducing the risk of systemic thromboembolism after STEMI, must be reconsidered in the era of DAPT (4,48). The availability of several P2Y12 receptor inhibitors has virtually eliminated the former reliance on vitamin K antagonists as an alternative to aspirin for aspirin-allergic patients. A meta-analysis of RCTs comparing warfarin plus aspirin to aspirin alone in patients with ACS showed that in studies with an international normalized ratio goal of 2.0 to 3.0, combination therapy was associated with a significant reduction in major adverse events at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding (521). None of the trials included patients treated with primary PCI or DAPT.\n\nTriple therapy with a vitamin K antagonist, aspirin, and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor should be restricted to specific clinical situations after STEMI in which the risk of systemic or venous thromboembolism or stent thrombosis is considered to exceed that of bleeding. Patient preferences and values should be taken into consideration, because individuals may weigh these outcomes differently. The novel oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran have not been evaluated in this context, and thus no recommendation for their use can be made. The duration of vitamin K antagonist therapy can be limited to 3 months in patients with or at risk for LV thrombus (e.g., those with anteroapical akinesis or dyskinesis), whereas the duration of DAPT could be predicated on stent type or whether STEMI treatment included a stent (219,522,523). For patients undergoing primary PCI who require anticoagulation, avoidance of a DES is strongly preferred. When triple therapy is used, an international normalized ratio targeted to a range of 2.0 to 2.5 might be reasonable, though prospective data are lacking. Use of DAPT alone with aspirin and clopidogrel also might be considered for patients with STEMI who have AF and low to intermediate CHADS2 scores (0 to 1), with reconsideration of the indications for anticoagulation over time (296,522).\n\nThe incidence of venous thromboembolic events after STEMI has declined significantly (526), though patients with HF or on prolonged bed rest remain at risk (527). The approach to the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease during hospitalization, with both pharmacological and mechanical measures, is similar to that for other critically ill patients (528).\n\nHIT, with or without associated thrombosis, can infrequently complicate the course of patients with ACS (529), particularly patients who previously have been exposed to heparin or who receive heparin over several hospital days. From 1% to 5% of all patients receiving heparin will develop HIT, and of these, 25% to 50% will develop thrombotic complications. In the CATCH (Complications After Thrombocytopenia Caused by Heparin) registry (530,531), thrombocytopenia was common among those who received heparin for \u003e96 hours (36.4%) and was associated with a significantly increased risk of death, MI, or HF. Recognition of HIT frequently was delayed, and treatment often did not include a direct thrombin inhibitor. Data on the use of direct thrombin inhibitors in patients with STEMI who develop HIT are limited (532,533). For patients with STEMI and HIT who require stenting, bivalirudin would be the preferred anticoagulant. Management of patients with HIT who require urgent CABG can be more difficult (534).\n\nDespite variable definitions for major and minor bleeding used in clinical trials, bleeding that complicates the course of an ACS, including STEMI, is independently associated with recurrent MI, stroke, death, longer hospital stay, and increased cost. The risk of death increases as a function of the severity of bleeding, independent of the success or failure of reperfusion therapy. In a pooled analysis from 4 ACS trials, the adjusted hazard ratio for death within 30 days ranged from 1.6 with mild bleeding to 10.6 with severe bleeding (535). Most bleeding is procedure related, although gastrointestinal and intracerebral bleeding may be more life threatening. Factors likely to contribute to adverse outcomes with ACS-related bleeding include patient comorbidities (536,537), discontinuation of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy in response to bleeding (536,538), and blood transfusion (539,540). Additional considerations include types of antiplatelet or anticoagulant agent at time of PCI (248,541,542), number of antithrombotic agents used (533), dosing (543), duration of therapy, crossover from low-molecular-weight heparin to UFH, HF or shock, diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease, and prior warfarin use. If triple antithrombotic therapy is required after discharge, the risk of bleeding increases (Figure 4) (533).\n\nFigure 4\n\nAdjusted risk of nonfatal and fatal bleeding in patients treated with aspirin, clopidogrel, and/or vitamin K antagonists after first MI.

Predictive models for major bleeding in patients with ACS and in patients undergoing PCI have been reported from the NCDR ACTION Registry–GWTG (547,548). An analysis from the ACTION Registry–GWTG suggests that the CRUSADE bleeding risk score, developed in patients with non–ST-elevation MI, may be extended to the STEMI population (549). Major bleeding occurred in 2.8% of \u003e40,000 patients with acute MI in the GRACE Registry (536). Patients who experienced a major bleeding episode were more likely to die in hospital than were those who did not bleed (20.9% versus 5.6%; p\u003c0.001), even after adjustment for several relevant demographic and clinical variables. One in 5 patients with a major bleed did not survive to hospital discharge; these patients accounted for 10% of all hospital deaths and were older, more severely ill, and more likely to undergo invasive procedures. In ExTRACT-TIMI 25 (Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment—Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 25), high 30-day mortality rates after major bleeding in patients with STEMI treated with fibrinolysis and either unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin were driven largely by the very poor prognosis associated with ICH (65% mortality rate) (537). The overall incidence of ICH in this study was 0.6% (332). The relationship between non-ICH bleeding and death in both ExTRACT-TIMI 25 and TRITON-TIMI 38 may have been confounded by patient attributes, severity of illness, and treatment protocols (537,550). To minimize the risk of bleeding complications, an assessment of patient, procedural, and pharmacological risk factors should be performed at time of presentation with STEMI and continuously thereafter. As an example, a longer time to PCI may be justifiable if the risk of hemorrhage with fibrinolysis is considered prohibitive.\n\nTable 13Selected Risk Factors for Bleeding in Patients With ACS\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nEvidence suggests that although anemia is a risk factor for bleeding, the threshold for transfusion should be high (551). Absent ongoing ischemia, transfusion should be avoided unless the hemoglobin level is \u003c8 mg/dL. The optimal hemoglobin level in the transfused patient is not known, but the number of units provided should be minimized (539,552).\n\nOlder age, female sex, low body weight (\u003c70 kg [female] and \u003c80 kg [male]), prior stroke, and hypertension on presentation (with a graded increase beginning at \u003e160 to 170 mm Hg systolic) are the major risk factors for ICH. Once ICH is recognized, all antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy should be stopped. Brain imaging with emergency neurological and neurosurgical consultation is required. Consideration can be given to the use of protamine, fresh frozen plasma, prothrombin complex concentrates, activated factor VII (555), and platelets as indicated. Resumption and timing of anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet therapy after ICH should be individualized and guided by neurosurgical consultation (556).\n\nVascular access site bleeding is the most common type of bleeding after STEMI, particularly after PCI. PCI trials have identified female sex, advanced age, renal insufficiency, anemia, IABP, use of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists, and low-molecular-weight heparin within 48 hours of PCI as risk factors for femoral access site bleeding (557). Larger sheath size, postprocedural heparin use, higher activated clotting times, and late postprocedural sheath removal increases the risk of access site bleeding and should be avoided. Radial artery access may decrease bleeding complications and should be considered whenever feasible (558), but procedural success with this technique is dependent on operator experience (559,560). Among patients with STEMI in the RIVAL (Radial Versus Femoral Access for Coronary Angiography and Intervention in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes) trial, radial artery access appeared to reduce the rate of the primary composite outcome (death, MI, stroke, non–CABG-related major bleeding) and the individual secondary outcomes of death, MI, stroke, and overall mortality. However, rates of major bleeding were not lower with radial versus femoral access in patients with STEMI, though rates of major vascular complications were significantly reduced (561). Although arterial closure devices have been associated with decreased femoral access site bleeding, more rapid hemostasis, and shorter duration of bed rest (251,562,563), their routine use cannot be advocated specifically to reduce vascular complications after PCI, given the lack of robust, directionally consistent data on their efficacy and safety compared with manual compression (564,565,566). Retroperitoneal bleeding should be suspected when the following are seen: unheralded intraprocedural or postprocedural hypotension and bradycardia (or tachycardia), high vascular puncture site, and an otherwise unexplained decrease in hemoglobin. Prompt computed tomographic imaging of the abdomen and pelvis may be helpful. Conservative management usually suffices, but early vascular interventional or surgical consultation should be obtained (219).\n\nThe risk of renal failure with STEMI relates to a host of factors, including patient age, prehospital renal function, medications, contrast volume, and hemodynamic status. Contrast-induced nephropathy after angiography and intervention for STEMI is always a risk, and attention to minimization of contrast volume and optimal hydration is required (219).\n\nThere is a U-shaped relationship between glucose levels and death in STEMI and ACS (567). The mortality rate associated with hypoglycemia appears to be as high as the mortality rate associated with hyperglycemia (568,569). Concern about overly aggressive glycemic control in critically ill patients was raised by the NICE-SUGAR (Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation) trial (570). In this study of medical and surgical intensive care unit patients, tight glucose control (81 to 108 mg/dL) compared to modest control (\u003c180 mg/dL) was associated with increased mortality rate (primarily from cardiovascular causes) and more episodes of hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels should be maintained below 180 mg/dL if possible while avoiding hypoglycemia. There is no established role for glucose-insulin-potassium infusions in patients with STEMI (571,572,573).\nRisk Assessment After STEMI\n\nInitial risk stratification should be performed early (Section 3) with the use of information available at the time of presentation. However, risk assessment is a continuous process that requires recalibration on the basis of data obtained during the hospital stay. Such data include the success of reperfusion therapy, events that occur during the hospital course (such as hemorrhagic complications), and the findings from noninvasive and invasive testing, particularly as they relate to the assessment of LV systolic function. For example, in patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy, clinical and ECG indicators of failed reperfusion identify individuals who should undergo urgent coronary angiography with intent to perform PCI (356). In addition, the emergence of HF or significant LV systolic dysfunction is among the strongest predictors of higher-mortality risk after STEMI.\n\nStable patients with a low risk of complications may be candidates for early discharge. Among patients with STEMI managed with fibrinolysis, it has been suggested that an uncomplicated course after 72 hours of hospitalization identifies a group with sufficiently low risk to enable discharge (574,575). Newby and colleagues calculated that extending the hospital stay of these patients by another day would cost $105,629 per year of life saved. However, the duration of hospitalization in patients treated with reperfusion therapy may be determined by other needs, such as patient education or titration of medications to optimum doses (576).\n\nPhysicians and patients must individualize strategies for risk reduction, using lifestyle interventions, disease-modifying pharmacological therapies, and additional coronary revascularization when indicated. All patients with STEMI are considered to be at sufficiently high risk to merit interventions for secondary prevention, including the use of cardiac rehabilitation, aspirin, lipid-lowering therapy, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors when indicated (257). Additional risk assessment should be used to guide decisions about performance of coronary angiography in patients who did not undergo an invasive evaluation as part of their initial treatment strategy and to guide consideration of interventions to reduce the risk of SCD due to arrhythmia.\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Noninvasive testing for ischemia should be performed before discharge to assess the presence and extent of inducible ischemia in patients with STEMI who have not had coronary angiography and do not have high-risk clinical features for which coronary angiography would be warranted (577,578,579). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCLASS IIb\n\n    1Noninvasive testing for ischemia might be considered before discharge to evaluate the functional significance of a noninfarct artery stenosis previously identified at angiography. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    2Noninvasive testing for ischemia might be considered before discharge to guide the postdischarge exercise prescription. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nNoninvasive testing for ischemia provides valuable information about the presence of residual ischemia in patients who have not undergone cardiac catheterization during initial management of STEMI and may be useful in assessing the functional significance of a noninfarct artery stenosis identified at angiography. In the latter instance, stress imaging to localize ischemia would be appropriate (580,581). Exercise testing early after STEMI may also be performed to 1) assess functional capacity and the ability to perform tasks at home and at work, 2) evaluate the efficacy of medical therapy, and 3) assess the risk of a subsequent cardiac event. Symptom-limited exercise testing is a key feature of the intake evaluation for enrollment in a program of cardiac rehabilitation ≥2 weeks after discharge (582).\n\nLow-level exercise testing after MI appears to be safe if patients have undergone in-hospital cardiac rehabilitation, including low-level exercise; have had no symptoms of angina or HF; and have a stable baseline ECG 48 to 72 hours before the test (583). Two different protocols have been used for early post-MI exercise testing: the traditional submaximal exercise test (done at 3 to 5 days in patients without complications) or a symptom-limited exercise test (done at 5 days or later) without stopping at a prespecified target heart rate or metabolic equivalent level. RCTs of early exercise testing after PCI have excluded patients with recent MI (584). Limited data exist on the safety of early symptom-limited exercise testing after MI; therefore, clinical judgment must be used (585). Pharmacological stress myocardial perfusion imaging has been shown to have predictive value for postinfarction cardiac events and is useful and safe in patients who are unable to exercise (586). The optimum timing for provocative testing for ischemia after STEMI remains unresolved. It is argued that a predischarge exercise test may provide psychological benefit to the patient and will permit detection of profound ischemia or other indicators of high risk that could be associated with postdischarge cardiac events that might occur before a symptom-limited stress test scheduled weeks later (585). A predischarge study also provides parameters for exercise prescription in the first few days after return home, before enrollment in cardiac rehabilitation. On the other hand, deferring exercise testing until approximately 3 weeks after STEMI in clinically low-risk patients appears safe and reasonable and enables more optimal assessment of functional capacity. It is the consensus of the writing committee that patients without complications who have not undergone coronary angiography and who might be potential candidates for revascularization should undergo provocative testing before hospital discharge. In patients with noninfarct artery disease who have undergone successful PCI of the infarct artery and have an uncomplicated course, it is reasonable to proceed with discharge and plans for close clinical follow-up with stress imaging within 3 to 6 weeks.\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1LVEF should be measured in all patients with STEMI. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nLV function is one of the strongest predictors of survival in patients with STEMI. LV function most commonly is evaluated with contrast ventriculography at the time of cardiac catheterization or with transthoracic echocardiography on day 2 or 3. Echocardiography is the most frequently used imaging modality to evaluate regional and global LV function after STEMI and can help characterize any associated mechanical complications when they are clinically suspected. Because of the dynamic nature of LV functional recovery after STEMI, clinicians should consider the timing of the imaging study relative to the index event. In patients with significant LV systolic dysfunction revealed during the initial hospitalization, LV function should be reevaluated ≥40 days later, especially to address the potential need for ICD therapy after allowance for recovery from myocardial stunning (496,587,588).\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Patients with an initially reduced LVEF who are possible candidates for ICD therapy should undergo reevaluation of LVEF 40 or more days after discharge (496,587,588,589). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nThe timing and character of ventricular arrhythmias and residual LV systolic function are the strongest predictors of SCD risk after STEMI. Management considerations for patients with ventricular arrhythmias during the hospital phase are reviewed in Section 9.5. Hospital survivors with an initially reduced LVEF (≤0.40) who do not merit ICD therapy before discharge should undergo reassessment of LV function ≥40 days later to determine their eligibility for ICD therapy. The recommended delay to ICD therapy in this setting stems from the results of DINAMIT (Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial), in which defibrillator implantation 6 to 40 days after MI in patients with EF ≤0.35 and impaired cardiac autonomic function was not shown to reduce overall cardiac death risk. The observed reduction in arrhythmic deaths was offset by a relative increase in the numbers of nonarrhythmic deaths (587). The IRIS (Immediate Risk Stratification Improves Survival) trial (588) also showed that early ICD therapy in patients with LVEF ≤0.40 and a high heart rate, nonsustained VT regardless of LVEF, or both did not result in improved survival. The utility of a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator in high-risk patients during the first 4 to 6 weeks after STEMI is under investigation (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00628966).\n\nThe indications for ICD therapy ≥40 days after STEMI are based on LVEF and New York Heart Association class, as derived from the results of the landmark MADIT 2 (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial 2) and SCDHeFT (Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure) trials (496,589,590,591). If LVEF remains ≤0.35 and the patient has New York Heart Association class II or III HF symptoms, or if the LVEF is ≤0.30 independent of symptoms, then ICD implantation is recommended (496). Indications for cardiac resynchronization therapy in the late, convalescent phase of STEMI include residual LV function, New York Heart Association class, QRS duration, and LBBB morphology (592).\n\nIn addition to determination of LVEF, several other noninvasive strategies have been proposed to identify patients at high risk for arrhythmic events after STEMI, such as signal-averaged or high-resolution ECG, heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity, and T-wave alternans (591). These strategies have not been adopted widely because of their limited performance characteristics and are not recommended for routine use.\nPosthospitalization Plan of Care\n\nCLASS I\n\n    1Posthospital systems of care designed to prevent hospital readmissions should be used to facilitate the transition to effective, coordinated outpatient care for all patients with STEMI (593,594,595,596,597). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention programs are recommended for patients with STEMI (598,599,600,601). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    3A clear, detailed, and evidence-based plan of care that promotes medication adherence, timely follow-up with the healthcare team, appropriate dietary and physical activities, and compliance with interventions for secondary prevention should be provided to patients with STEMI. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    4Encouragement and advice to stop smoking and to avoid secondhand smoke should be provided to patients with STEMI (602,603,604,605). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\nEducation of patients with STEMI and their families is critical and often challenging, especially when transitions of care occur. Failure to understand and comply with a plan of care may account for the high rate of STEMI rehospitalization rates seen in the United States (19,606). One key intervention to ensure effective coordination is to provide to patients and caregivers, during the hospital stay, a comprehensive plan of care and educational materials that promote compliance with recommended evidence-based therapies (607,608,609). The posthospitalization plan of care for patients with STEMI should address in detail several complex issues, including medication adherence and titration, timely follow-up, dietary interventions, physical and sexual activities, cardiac rehabilitation, compliance with interventions for secondary prevention (Table 14), and reassessment of arrhythmic and HF risks. In addition, providers should pay close attention to psychosocial and socioeconomic issues, including access to care, risk of depression, social isolation, and healthcare disparities (610,611,612).\n\nTable 14Plan of Care for Patients With STEMI\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nThe value of smoking cessation for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease has been demonstrated in several prospective observational studies. A meta-analysis of cohort studies in patients after acute MI showed that smoking cessation reduced the subsequent cardiovascular mortality rate by nearly 50% (602), ranking it among the most powerful secondary prevention strategies (603). The SAVE (Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints) study investigators reported that in selected patients with LV systolic dysfunction after MI, smoking cessation, compared with continued smoking, is associated with a 40% lower hazard of all-cause mortality and a 30% lower hazard of death, recurrent MI, or HF hospitalization (605).\n\nReasonable evidence from RCTs indicates that counseling hospitalized smokers after acute MI increases smoking cessation rates, provided that the initial contact during the hospital stay is followed by repeated contacts, usually by telephone, for ≥3 months after discharge (603,604). Similarly, the odds of smoking cessation are greater among patients who receive discharge recommendations for cardiac rehabilitation (604). Patients with depressive symptoms during the MI hospitalization and early convalescence are less likely to quit smoking and may require more intensive treatment to achieve cessation (603,604). Counseling should be provided to the patient and family, along with pharmacological therapy as deemed safe, and access to formal smoking-cessation programs should be facilitated.\n\nThe objectives of contemporary exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation are to increase functional capacity, decrease or alleviate anginal symptoms, reduce disability, improve quality of life, modify coronary risk factors, and reduce morbidity and mortality rates (598,613,614). Core components include patient assessment; ongoing medical surveillance; nutritional counseling; BP, lipid, and diabetes mellitus management; smoking cessation; psychosocial counseling; physical activity counseling; exercise training; and pharmacological treatment, as appropriate (614).\n\nAmong 601,099 U.S. Medicare beneficiaries who were hospitalized for coronary conditions or revascularization procedures, mortality rates were 21% to 34% lower among participants in cardiac rehabilitation programs than among nonparticipants (599). It has been suggested that contemporary reperfusion and cardioprotective drug therapies may diminish the impact of adjunctive exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programs on post-MI survival rate. Taylor et al. (600) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of cardiac rehabilitation with ≥6 months of follow-up. The study population included 8,940 patients, a greater number were women (20% of the cohort), patients ≥65 years of age, and individuals who had undergone revascularization procedures. Compared with usual care, cardiac rehabilitation was associated with a reduction in total and cardiac mortality rates of 20% and 26%, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed that the decreased mortality rates did not differ across several patient subsets, between programs limited to exercise and those providing more comprehensive secondary interventions, or between pre- and post-1995 studies, which suggests that the mortality benefits of cardiac rehabilitation persist in the modern era. However, despite these impressive outcomes, cardiac rehabilitation services remain vastly underutilized (582,615).\n\nMeaningful evidence has facilitated a much better understanding of the systems changes necessary to achieve safer care (616). This includes the adoption by all U.S. hospitals of a standardized set of “Safe Practices” endorsed by the National Quality Forum (617), which overlap in many ways with the National Patient Safety Goals espoused by The Joint Commission (618). Examples of patient safety standards that should be ensured for all patients discharged after STEMI include improved communication among physicians, nurses, and pharmacists; medication reconciliation; careful transitions between care settings; and consistent documentation. The National Quality Forum also has endorsed a set of patient-centered “Preferred Practices for Care Coordination,” (619) which detail comprehensive specifications that are necessary to achieve the goals of successful care coordination for patients and their families. Systems of care designed to support patients with STEMI and other cardiac diseases can result in significant improvement in patient outcomes. To provide the interventions and services listed in Table 14, appropriate resources must be applied to ensure that all patients with STEMI have full access to evidence-based therapies and follow-up care. There is a growing emphasis on penalizing hospitals for avoidable hospital readmissions. Hence, it is imperative for health systems to work in partnership with physicians, nurses, pharmacists, communities, payers, and public agencies to support the interventions that achieve such comprehensive care.\n\nPatient characteristics may be important predictors of readmission after MI; however, only a few variables have been identified consistently (620,621). From a policy perspective, a validated risk-standardized model that uses readmission rates to profile hospitals is not currently available.\nUnresolved Issues and Future Research Directions\n\nThe writing committee has identified several areas pertaining to the management of patients with STEMI that deserve further research. Although the observations from the Swedish STEMI registry showing an association between the increased use of evidence-based treatments and declining mortality rates after STEMI are encouraging (18), additional efforts to improve patient outcomes are needed. There is widespread acknowledgment that progress in closing existing knowledge and performance gaps will require contributions from a wide range of investigators, dedicated clinicians, hospital and health plan administrators, regional emergency response systems, and both government and private payers (631).\n\nDelay times from onset of symptoms to activation of STEMI care pathways remain unacceptably long (51,631). Multicultural efforts to educate, reassure, and motivate at-risk patients and their families are needed. Comparable efforts to improve adherence and attention to healthy lifestyle behaviors as the cornerstones of secondary prevention are required at time of discharge and as an integral feature of cardiac rehabilitation programs.\n\nThe adoption of regional systems of care for patients with STEMI across diverse geographical areas has proved challenging, and inappropriate delays to initiation of reperfusion therapy are common (632). As previously emphasized, attention should be focused on reducing the total ischemic time, from onset of symptoms to successful reperfusion. Several factors in addition to patient activation of EMS contribute to delays, not all of which can be reconciled. Areas for continued research include prehospital EMS protocols, the approach to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, triage and transfer algorithms, rapid availability of expert PCI services, and further refinement of the clinical and time-related factors that should prompt earlier use of fibrinolytic therapy coupled with immediate transfer for PCI (129,633,634,635). The lack of correlation between shorter D2B times and reduced mortality should drive further efforts to improve all aspects of STEMI care (636). Regional systems should track, analyze, and report all STEMI and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest events as part of an ongoing process-improvement program.\n\nThe indications for and timing of transfer for angiography with a view toward revascularization of non–high-risk patients after successful fibrinolysis are still debated. Although there has been increasing activation of this pathway, the evidence base for its justification is still limited (358,360,365).\n\nThe optimum choice of P2Y12 receptor inhibitor and anticoagulant agents for patients with STEMI can be challenging. Individual genetic variability in drug absorption, metabolism, and effectiveness has been highlighted by the experience with clopidogrel in patients with ACS (285,637). The risks of bleeding also may vary across racial and ethnic groups (12). The roles of platelet function testing and genetic screening for clopidogrel metabolism in the acute phase of STEMI care are uncertain (289), especially with the availability of alternative P2Y12 receptor inhibitors. More information specific to patients with STEMI is needed with regard to the use of prasugrel, ticagrelor, novel factor Xa and IIa antagonists, and platelet protease–activated receptor 1 antagonists (638,639). The efficacy and safety of combination (“triple”) antithrombotic therapy must be addressed continuously (525,537), while less hazardous approaches are tested. Bleeding rates with radial versus femoral artery access for PCI warrant further prospective study (561).\n\nAside from manual aspiration thrombectomy, efforts to counteract the “no-reflow” phenomenon and to limit myocardial reperfusion injury have had limited success. The value of aspiration thrombectomy in patients with anterior STEMI has been questioned (223). Remote ischemic preconditioning has engendered little enthusiasm. Trials evaluating the use of antithrombotic and vasodilator agents have been disappointing. New biological, pharmacological, and mechanical strategies should be investigated to facilitate prompt recovery of tissue-level perfusion (220,640,641,642,644). In addition, high-dose statin pretreatment before primary or delayed PCI for STEMI requires further study (645).\n\nThere is great variability in the evaluation and management of nonculprit coronary artery disease in stable patients without HF or shock, both at the time of primary PCI and later during the hospital course. Physiological assessment of lesion significance is often not performed, and the decision to proceed with PCI is made on anatomic grounds. More work is needed to clarify the indications for and timing of noninfarct artery revascularization (218,224,228,229).\n\nPrediction of electrical vulnerability and SCD risk after STEMI is fraught with imprecision. Treatment decisions rely almost exclusively on parameters of LV systolic function. Optimal therapy for at-risk individuals in the time window between discharge and 40 days, the time point after which ICD therapy is currently recommended, has not been established. Improved prediction rules and validated treatment recommendations are urgently needed (646).\n\nMuch progress has been made to limit LV remodeling, though there remains substantial room for improvement, beginning with the timeliness of reperfusion and initiation of ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy (627). The superimposition of ischemic mitral regurgitation adds further to the risks of HF and death. Continued exploration of the roles of cell- and gene-based therapies after STEMI is encouraged (647,648,649,650,651,652,653,654,655,656).\nPresidents and Staff\n\n    William A.

College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) are committed to the prevention and management of cardiovascular diseases through professional education and research for clinicians, providers, and patients. Since 1980, the ACC and AHA have shared a responsibility to translate scientific evidence into clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) with recommendations to standardize and improve cardiovascular health. These CPGs, based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a cornerstone of quality cardiovascular care.\n\nIn response to published reports from the Institute of Medicine (1,2) and the ACC/AHA’s mandate to evaluate new knowledge and maintain relevance at the point of care, the ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Task Force) began modifying its methodology. This modernization effort is published in the 2012 Methodology Summit Report (3) and 2014 perspective article (4). The latter recounts the history of the collaboration, changes over time, current policies, and planned initiatives to meet the needs of an evolving healthcare environment. Recommendations on value in proportion to resource utilization will be incorporated as high-quality comparative-effectiveness data become available (5). The relationships between CPGs and data standards, appropriate use criteria, and performance measures are addressed elsewhere (4).\n\nIntended Use—CPGs provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but CPGs developed in collaboration with other organizations may have a broader target. Although CPGs may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve the quality of care and be aligned with the patient\u0027s best interest.\n\nEvidence Review—Guideline writing committee (GWC) members are charged with reviewing the literature; weighing the strength and quality of evidence for or against particular tests, treatments, or procedures; and estimating expected health outcomes when data exist. In analyzing the data and developing CPGs, the GWC uses evidence-based methodologies developed by the Task Force (6). A key component of the ACC/AHA CPG methodology is the development of recommendations on the basis of all available evidence. Literature searches focus on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) but also include registries, nonrandomized comparative and descriptive studies, case series, cohort studies, systematic reviews, and expert opinion. Only selected references are cited in the CPG. To ensure that CPGs remain current, new data are reviewed biannually by the GWCs and the Task Force to determine if recommendations should be updated or modified. In general, a target cycle of 5 years is planned for full revisions (1).\n\nGuideline-Directed Medical Therapy—Recognizing advances in medical therapy across the spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, the Task Force designated the term “guideline-directed medical therapy” (GDMT) to represent recommended medical therapy as defined mainly by Class I measures, generally a combination of lifestyle modification and drug- and device-based therapeutics. As medical science advances, GDMT evolves, and hence GDMT is preferred to “optimal medical therapy.” For GDMT and all other recommended drug treatment regimens, the reader should confirm the dosage with product insert material and carefully evaluate for contraindications and possible drug interactions. Recommendations are limited to treatments, drugs, and devices approved for clinical use in the United States.\n\nClass of Recommendation and Level of Evidence—Once recommendations are written, the Class of Recommendation (COR; i.e., the strength the GWC assigns to the recommendation, which encompasses the anticipated magnitude and judged certainty of benefit in proportion to risk) is assigned by the GWC. Concurrently, the Level of Evidence (LOE) rates the scientific evidence supporting the effect of the intervention on the basis on the type, quality, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other reports (Table 1) (4). Unless otherwise stated, recommendations are presented in order by the COR and then the LOE. Where comparative data exist, preferred strategies take precedence. When more than 1 drug, strategy, or therapy exists within the same COR and LOE and there are no comparative data, options are listed alphabetically.\n\nTable 1Applying Classification of Recommendations and Level of Evidence\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nRelationships With Industry and Other Entities—The ACC and AHA exclusively sponsor the work of GWCs without commercial support, and members volunteer their time for this activity. The Task Force makes every effort to avoid actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of interest that might arise through relationships with industry or other entities (RWI). All GWC members and reviewers are required to fully disclose current industry relationships or personal interests from 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. Management of RWI involves selecting a balanced GWC and requires that both the chair and a majority of GWC members have no relevant RWI (see Appendix 1 for the definition of relevance). GWC members are restricted with regard to writing or voting on sections to which their RWI apply. In addition, for transparency, GWC members’ comprehensive disclosure information is available as an online supplement. Comprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is available as an additional supplement. The Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds representing different geographic regions, sexes, ethnicities, races, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice. Selected organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise are invited to participate as partners or collaborators.\n\nIndividualizing Care in Patients With Associated Conditions and Comorbidities—The ACC and AHA recognize the complexity of managing patients with multiple conditions, compared with managing patients with a single disease, and the challenge is compounded when CPGs for evaluation or treatment of several coexisting illnesses are discordant or interacting (7). CPGs attempt to define practices that meet the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances and do not replace clinical judgment.\n\nClinical Implementation—Management in accordance with CPG recommendations is effective only when followed; therefore, to enhance their commitment to treatment and compliance with lifestyle adjustment, clinicians should engage the patient to participate in selecting interventions on the basis of the patient’s individual values and preferences, taking associated conditions and comorbidities into consideration (e.g., shared decision making). Consequently, there are circumstances in which deviations from these guidelines are appropriate.\n\nThe recommendations in this CPG are the official policy of the ACC and AHA until they are superseded by a published addendum, focused update, or revised full-text CPG.\n\nJeffrey L. Anderson, MD, FACC, FAHA\n\nChair, ACC/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines\nIntroduction\n\nThe recommendations listed in this CPG are, whenever possible, evidence based. An extensive evidence review was conducted through October 2012, and other selected references published through April 2014 were reviewed by the GWC. Literature included was derived from research involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Reports, and other selected databases relevant to this CPG. The relevant data are included in evidence tables in the Online Data Supplement. Key search words included but were not limited to the following: acute coronary syndrome, anticoagulant therapy, antihypertensives, anti-ischemic therapy, antiplatelet therapy, antithrombotic therapy, beta blockers, biomarkers, calcium channel blockers, cardiac rehabilitation, conservative management, diabetes mellitus, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, heart failure, invasive strategy, lifestyle modification, myocardial infarction, nitrates, non–ST-elevation, P2Y12receptor inhibitor, percutaneous coronary intervention, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors, secondary prevention, smoking cessation, statins, stent, thienopyridines, troponins, unstable angina, and weight management. Additionally, the GWC reviewed documents related to non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) previously published by the ACC and AHA. References selected and published in this document are representative and not all-inclusive.\n\nThe GWC was composed of clinicians, cardiologists, internists, interventionists, surgeons, emergency medicine specialists, family practitioners, and geriatricians. The GWC included representatives from the ACC and AHA, American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Emergency Physicians, American College of Physicians, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI), and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS).\n\nThis document was reviewed by 2 official reviewers each nominated by the ACC and AHA; 1 reviewer each from the American Academy of Family Physicians, American College of Emergency Physicians, SCAI, and STS; and 37 individual content reviewers (including members of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry, ACC Heart Failure and Transplant Section Leadership Council, ACC Cardiovascular Imaging Section Leadership Council, ACC Interventional Section Leadership Council, ACC Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease Committee, ACC Surgeons’ Council, Association of International Governors, and Department of Health and Human Services). Reviewers’ RWI information was distributed to the GWC and is published in this document (Appendix 2).\n\nThis document was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACC and the AHA and endorsed by the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, SCAI, and the STS.\n\nThe 2014 NSTE-ACS CPG is a full revision of the 2007 ACCF/AHA CPG for the management of patients with unstable angina (UA) and non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and the 2012 focused update (8). The new title, “Non–ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes,” emphasizes the continuum between UA and NSTEMI. At presentation, patients with UA and NSTEMI can be indistinguishable and are therefore considered together in this CPG.\n\nIn the United States, NSTE-ACS affects \u003e625,000 patients annually,∗\n\n∗ Estimate includes secondary discharge diagnoses.\nor almost three fourths of all patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (9). In selecting the initial approach to care, the term “ischemia-guided strategy” has replaced the previous descriptor, “initial conservative management,” to more clearly convey the physiological rationale of this approach.\n\nThe task of the 2014 GWC was to establish a contemporary CPG for the optimal management of patients with NSTE-ACS. It incorporates both established and new evidence from published clinical trials, as well as information from basic science and comprehensive review articles. These recommendations were developed to guide the clinician in improving outcomes for patients with NSTE-ACS. Table 2 lists documents deemed pertinent to this effort and is intended for use as a resource, thus obviating the need to repeat extant CPG recommendations.\n\nTable 2Associated CPGs and Statements\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nThe GWC abbreviated the discussion sections to include an explanation of salient information related to the recommendations. In contrast to textbook declaratory presentations, explanations were supplemented with evidence tables. The GWC also provided a brief summary of the relevant recommendations and references related to secondary prevention rather than detailed reiteration. Throughout, the goal was to provide the clinician with concise, evidence-based contemporary recommendations and the supporting documentation to encourage their application.\nOverview of ACS\n\nACS has evolved as a useful operational term that refers to a spectrum of conditions compatible with acute myocardial ischemia and/or infarction that are usually due to an abrupt reduction in coronary blood flow (Figure 1). A key branch point is ST-segment elevation (ST-elevation) or new left bundle-branch block on the electrocardiogram (ECG), which is an indication for immediate coronary angiography to determine if there is an indication for reperfusion therapy to open a likely completely occluded coronary artery. Separate CPGs have been developed for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (17).\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1\n\nAcute Coronary Syndromes\n\nThe top half of the figure illustrates the progression of plaque formation and onset and complications of NSTE-ACS, with management at each stage. The numbered section of an artery depicts the process of atherogenesis from 1) normal artery to 2) extracellular lipid in the subintima to 3) fibrofatty stage to 4) procoagulant expression and weakening of the fibrous cap. ACS develops with 5) disruption of the fibrous cap, which is the stimulus for thrombogenesis. 6) Thrombus resorption may be followed by collagen accumulation and smooth muscle cell growth. Thrombus formation and possible coronary vasospasm reduce blood flow in the affected coronary artery and cause ischemic chest pain.\n\nThe bottom half of the figure illustrates the clinical, pathological, electrocardiographic, and biomarker correlates in ACS and the general approach to management. Flow reduction may be related to a completely occlusive thrombus (bottom half, right side) or subtotally occlusive thrombus (bottom half, left side). Most patients with ST-elevation (thick white arrow in bottom panel) develop QwMI, and a few (thin white arrow) develop NQMI. Those without ST-elevation have either UA or NSTEMI (thick red arrows), a distinction based on cardiac biomarkers. Most patients presenting with NSTEMI develop NQMI; a few may develop QwMI. The spectrum of clinical presentations including UA, NSTEMI, and STEMI is referred to as ACS. This NSTE-ACS CPG includes sections on initial management before NSTE-ACS, at the onset of NSTE-ACS, and during the hospital phase. Secondary prevention and plans for long-term management begin early during the hospital phase. Patients with noncardiac etiologies make up the largest group presenting to the ED with chest pain (dashed arrow).\n\n*Elevated cardiac biomarker (e.g., troponin), Section 3.4.\n\nACS indicates acute coronary syndrome; CPG, clinical practice guideline; Dx, diagnosis; ECG, electrocardiogram; ED, emergency department; MI, myocardial infarction; NQMI, non–Q-wave myocardial infarction; NSTE-ACS, non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes; NSTEMI, non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction; QwMI, Q-wave myocardial infarction; STEMI, ST-elevation myocardial infarction; and UA, unstable angina.\n\nImage not available.\nView Large  | Download Slide (.ppt) | View in Article Context\n\nThe absence of persistent ST-elevation is suggestive of NSTE-ACS (except in patients with true posterior myocardial infarction [MI], Sections 3.3.2.4, 4.3.2, and 7.2.2). NSTE-ACS can be further subdivided on the basis of cardiac biomarkers of necrosis (e.g., cardiac troponin, Sections 3.2.4 and 3.4). If cardiac biomarkers are elevated and the clinical context is appropriate, the patient is considered to have NSTEMI (34); otherwise, the patient is deemed to have UA. ST depression, transient ST-elevation, and/or prominent T-wave inversions may be present but are not required for a diagnosis of NSTEMI. Abnormalities on the ECG and elevated troponins in isolation are insufficient to make the diagnosis of ACS but must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context. Thus, UA and NSTEMI are closely related conditions whose pathogenesis and clinical presentations are similar but vary in severity. The conditions differ primarily by whether the ischemia is severe enough to cause myocardial damage leading to detectable quantities of myocardial injury biomarkers. The term “possible ACS” is often assigned during initial evaluation if the ECG is unrevealing and troponin data are not yet available. UA can present without any objective data of myocardial ischemic injury (normal ECG and normal troponin), in which case the initial diagnosis depends solely on the patient’s clinical history and the clinician’s interpretation and judgment. However, with the increasing sensitivity of troponin assays, biomarker-negative ACS (i.e., UA) is becoming rarer (39). The pathogenesis of ACS is considered in the “Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction” (21). This statement defines MI caused by a primary coronary artery process such as spontaneous plaque rupture as MI type 1 and one related to reduced myocardial oxygen supply and/or increased myocardial oxygen demand (in the absence of a direct coronary artery process) as a MI type 2 (Appendix 4, Table A and Section 3.4 for an additional discussion on the diagnosis of MI).\n\nIn the United States, the median age at ACS presentation is 68 years (interquartile range 56 to 79), and the male-to-female ratio is approximately 3:2 (40). Some patients have a history of stable angina, whereas in others, ACS is the initial presentation of coronary artery disease (CAD). It is estimated that in the United States, each year, \u003e780,000 persons will experience an ACS. Approximately 70% of these will have NSTE-ACS (9). Patients with NSTE-ACS typically have more comorbidities, both cardiac and noncardiac, than patients with STEMI.\n\nThe hallmark of ACS is the sudden imbalance between myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) and demand, which is usually the result of coronary artery obstruction. The imbalance may also be caused by other conditions, including excessive myocardial oxygen demand in the setting of a stable flow-limiting lesion; acute coronary insufficiency due to other causes (e.g., vasospastic [Prinzmetal] angina [Section 7.11], coronary embolism, coronary arteritis); noncoronary causes of myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch (e.g., hypotension, severe anemia, hypertension, tachycardia, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, severe aortic stenosis); nonischemic myocardial injury (e.g., myocarditis, cardiac contusion, cardiotoxic drugs); and multifactorial causes that are not mutually exclusive (e.g., stress [Takotsubo] cardiomyopathy [Section 7.13], pulmonary embolism, severe heart failure [HF], sepsis) (41).\nInitial Evaluation and Management\n\n    Class I\n    1.Patients with suspected ACS should be risk stratified based on the likelihood of ACS and adverse outcome(s) to decide on the need for hospitalization and assist in the selection of treatment options (42–44). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nPatients with suspected ACS must be evaluated rapidly to identify those with a life-threatening emergency versus those with a more benign condition. The goal of the initial evaluation focuses on answering 2 questions:\n\n    1.What is the likelihood that the symptoms and signs represent ACS?\n    2.What is the likelihood of adverse clinical outcome(s)?\n\nRisk assessment scores and clinical prediction algorithms using clinical history, physical examination, ECG, and cardiac troponins have been developed to help identify patients with ACS at increased risk of adverse outcome(s). Common risk assessment tools include the TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) risk score (42), the PURSUIT (Platelet Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in Unstable Angina: Receptor Suppression Using Integrilin Therapy) risk score (43), the GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) risk score (44), and the NCDR-ACTION (National Cardiovascular Data Registry-Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network) registry (https://www.ncdr.com/webncdr/action/). These assessment tools have been applied with variable efficacy to predict outcomes in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with undifferentiated chest pain (“pain” encompasses not only pain, but also symptoms such as discomfort, pressure, and squeezing) (45–48). The Sanchis score (49), Vancouver rule (50), Heart (History, ECG, Age, Risk Factors, and Troponin) score (51), HEARTS3 score (52), and Hess prediction rule (53) were developed specifically for patients in the ED with chest pain. Although no definitive study has demonstrated the superiority of risk assessment scores or clinical prediction rules over clinician judgment, determination of the level of risk on initial evaluation is imperative to guide patient management, including the need for additional diagnostic testing and treatment. See Section 3.2.2 for a discussion of risk stratification variables.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 1for additional information on clinical assessment and initial evaluation.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Patients with suspected ACS and high-risk features such as continuing chest pain, severe dyspnea, syncope/presyncope, or palpitations should be referred immediately to the ED and transported by emergency medical services when available. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.Patients with less severe symptoms may be considered for referral to the ED, a chest pain unit, or a facility capable of performing adequate evaluation depending on clinical circumstances. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nPatients with suspected ACS and high-risk features should be transported to the ED by emergency medical services when available. Hospitals and outpatient facilities should provide clearly visible signage directing patients transported by private vehicle to the appropriate triage area. Outpatient facilities should have the capacity for ECG and cardiac troponin measurements with immediate ED referral for those considered to have ACS.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of NSTE-ACS includes (41):\n\n    •Nonischemic cardiovascular causes of chest pain (e.g., aortic dissection, expanding aortic aneurysm, pericarditis, pulmonary embolism)\n    •Noncardiovascular causes of chest, back, or upper abdominal discomfort include:\n        oPulmonary causes (e.g., pneumonia, pleuritis, pneumothorax)\n        oGastrointestinal causes (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal spasm, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis, biliary disease)\n        oMusculoskeletal causes (e.g., costochondritis, cervical radiculopathy)\n        oPsychiatric disorders\n        oOther etiologies (e.g., sickle cell crisis, herpes zoster)\n\nIn addition, the clinician should differentiate NSTE-ACS from acute coronary insufficiency due to a nonatherosclerotic cause and noncoronary causes of myocardial oxygen supply-demand mismatch (41) (Section 2.2.2).\n\nNSTE-ACS most commonly presents as a pressure-type chest pain that typically occurs at rest or with minimal exertion lasting ≥10 minutes (41). The pain most frequently starts in the retrosternal area and can radiate to either or both arms, the neck, or the jaw. Pain may also occur in these areas independent of chest pain. Patients with NSTE-ACS may also present with diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, abdominal pain, or syncope. Unexplained new-onset or increased exertional dyspnea is the most common angina equivalent. Less common presentations include nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis, unexplained fatigue, and syncope. Factors that increase the probability of NSTE-ACS are older age, male sex, positive family history of CAD, and the presence of peripheral arterial disease, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, prior MI, and prior coronary revascularization. Although older patients (≥75 years of age) and women usually present with typical symptoms of ACS, the frequency of atypical presentations is increased in these groups as well as in patients with diabetes mellitus, impaired renal function, and dementia (54,55). Atypical symptoms, including epigastric pain, indigestion, stabbing or pleuritic pain, and increasing dyspnea in the absence of chest pain should raise concern for NSTE-ACS (56). Psychiatric disorders (e.g., somatoform disorders, panic attack, anxiety disorders) are noncardiac causes of chest pain that can mimic ACS (57).\n\nThe physical examination in NSTE-ACS can be normal, but signs of HF should expedite the diagnosis and treatment of this condition. Acute myocardial ischemia may cause a S4, a paradoxical splitting of S2, or a new murmur of mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle dysfunction. However, these signs may also exist without NSTE-ACS and thus are nonspecific. The coupling of pain on palpation suggesting musculoskeletal disease or inflammation with a pulsatile abdominal mass suggesting abdominal aortic aneurysm raises concern for nonischemic causes of NSTE-ACS. The physical examination can indicate alternative diagnoses in patients with chest pain, several of which are life threatening. Aortic dissection is suggested by back pain, unequal palpated pulse volume, a difference of ≥15 mm Hg between both arms in systolic blood pressure (BP), or a murmur of aortic regurgitation. Acute pericarditis is suggested by a pericardial friction rub. Cardiac tamponade can be reflected by pulsus paradoxus. Pneumothorax is suspected when acute dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and differential breath sounds are present. A pleural friction rub may indicate pneumonitis or pleuritis.\n\nA 12-lead ECG should be performed and interpreted within 10 minutes of the patient’s arrival at an emergency facility to assess for cardiac ischemia or injury (21). Changes on ECG in patients with NSTE-ACS include ST depression, transient ST-elevation, or new T-wave inversion (21,58). Persistent ST-elevation or anterior ST depression indicative of true posterior MI should be treated according to the STEMI CPG (17). The ECG can be relatively normal or initially nondiagnostic; if this is the case, the ECG should be repeated (e.g., at 15- to 30-minute intervals during the first hour), especially if symptoms recur (21). A normal ECG does not exclude ACS and occurs in 1% to 6% of such patients (59–61). A normal ECG may also be associated with left circumflex or right coronary artery occlusions, which can be electrically silent (in which case posterior electrocardiographic leads [V7 to V9] may be helpful). Right-sided leads (V3R to V4R) are typically performed in the case of inferior STEMI to detect evidence of right ventricular infarction. Left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, bundle-branch blocks with repolarization abnormalities, and ventricular pacing may mask signs of ischemia/injury (62).\n\nCardiac troponins are the most sensitive and specific biomarkers for NSTE-ACS. They rise within a few hours of symptom onset and typically remain elevated for several days (but may remain elevated for up to 2 weeks with a large infarction). A negative cardiac troponin obtained with more sensitive cardiac troponin assays on admission confers a \u003e95% negative predictive value for MI compared with high-sensitivity assays that confer a negative predictive value ≥99% (63–65). See Section 3.4 for a detailed review of biomarkers for the diagnosis of MI.\n\nA chest roentgenogram is useful to identify potential pulmonary causes of chest pain and may show a widened mediastinum in patients with aortic dissection. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest with intravenous contrast can help exclude pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection. Transthoracic echocardiography can identify a pericardial effusion and tamponade physiology and may also be useful to detect regional wall motion abnormalities. Transesophageal echocardiography can identify a proximal aortic dissection. In low-risk patients with chest pain, coronary CT angiography can result in a more rapid, more cost-effective diagnosis than stress myocardial perfusion imaging (66).\n\nSee Table 4 for a summary of recommendations from this section.\n\n    Class I\n    1.In patients with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of ACS, a 12-lead ECG should be performed and evaluated for ischemic changes within 10 minutes of the patient’s arrival at an emergency facility (21). (Level of Evidence: C)\n    2.If the initial ECG is not diagnostic but the patient remains symptomatic and there is a high clinical suspicion for ACS, serial ECGs (e.g., 15- to 30-minute intervals during the first hour) should be performed to detect ischemic changes. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    3.Serial cardiac troponin I or T levels (when a contemporary assay is used) should be obtained at presentation and 3 to 6 hours after symptom onset (see Section 3.4, Class I, #3 recommendation if time of symptom onset is unclear) in all patients who present with symptoms consistent with ACS to identify a rising and/or falling pattern of values (21,64,67–71). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    4.Additional troponin levels should be obtained beyond 6 hours after symptom onset (see Section 3.4, Class I, #3 recommendation if time of symptom onset is unclear) in patients with normal troponin levels on serial examination when changes on ECG and/or clinical presentation confer an intermediate or high index of suspicion for ACS (21,72–74). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    5.Risk scores should be used to assess prognosis in patients with NSTE-ACS (42–44,75–80). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.Risk-stratification models can be useful in management (42–44,75–81). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.It is reasonable to obtain supplemental electrocardiographic leads V7 to V9 in patients whose initial ECG is nondiagnostic and who are at intermediate/high risk of ACS (82–84). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.Continuous monitoring with 12-lead ECG may be a reasonable alternative in patients whose initial ECG is nondiagnostic and who are at intermediate/high risk of ACS (85,86). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.Measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide or N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide may be considered to assess risk in patients with suspected ACS (87–91). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nAssessment of prognosis guides initial clinical evaluation and treatment and is useful for selecting the site of care (coronary care unit, monitored step-down unit, or outpatient monitored unit), antithrombotic therapies (e.g., P2Y12 inhibitors, platelet glycoprotein [GP] IIb/IIIa inhibitors [Sections 4.3.1.2 and 5.1.2.2]), and invasive management (Sections 4.4.2.1, 4.3.1, 4.4, 4.4.4, 4.4.5). There is a strong relationship between indicators of ischemia due to CAD and prognosis (Table 3 and Figure 2). Patients with a high likelihood of ischemia due to CAD are at greater risk of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE) than patients with a lower likelihood of ischemia due to CAD. Risk is highest at the time of presentation but remains elevated past the acute phase. By 6 months, NSTE-ACS mortality rates may equal or exceed those of STEMI (58). By 12 months, rates of death, MI, and recurrent instability in contemporary registries are \u003e10%. Early events are related to the ruptured coronary plaque and thrombosis, and later events are more closely associated with the pathophysiology of chronic atherosclerosis and LV systolic function (92–98).\n\nTable 3TIMI Risk Score∗ for NSTE-ACS\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nTable 4Summary of Recommendations for Prognosis: Early Risk Stratification\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2\n\nGlobal Registry of Acute Coronary Events Risk Calculator for In-Hospital Mortality for Acute Coronary Syndrome\n\nImage not available.\nView Large  | Download Slide (.ppt) | View in Article Context\n\nAt initial presentation, the clinical history, anginal symptoms and equivalents, physical examination, ECG, renal function, and cardiac troponin measurements can be integrated into an estimation of the risk of death and nonfatal cardiac ischemic events (Table 3 and Figure 2) (42,78).\n\nIn patients with or without known CAD, clinicians must determine whether the presentation is consistent with acute ischemia, stable ischemic heart disease, or an alternative etiology. Factors in the initial clinical history related to the likelihood of acute ischemia include age, sex, symptoms, prior history of CAD, and the number of traditional risk factors (99–105).\n\nThe characteristics of angina include deep, poorly localized chest or arm pain that is reproducibly associated with exertion or emotional stress (106). Angina is relieved promptly (i.e., in \u003c5 minutes) with rest and/or short-acting nitroglycerin. Patients with NSTE-ACS may have typical or atypical anginal symptoms, but episodes are more severe and prolonged, may occur at rest, or may be precipitated by less exertion than the patient previously experienced. Some patients have no chest pain but present solely with dyspnea or with arm, shoulder, back, jaw, neck, epigastric, or ear discomfort (107–109).\n\nFeatures not characteristic of myocardial ischemia include:\n\n    •Pleuritic pain (sharp or knifelike pain provoked by respiration or cough);\n    •Primary or sole location of discomfort in the middle or lower abdomen;\n    •Pain localized by the tip of 1 finger, particularly at the LV apex or costochondral junction;\n    •Pain reproduced with movement or palpation of the chest wall or arms;\n    •Brief episodes of pain lasting a few seconds or less;\n    •Pain that is of maximal intensity at onset; and\n    •Pain that radiates into the lower extremities.\n\nEvaluation should include the clinician’s impression of whether the pain represents a high, intermediate, or low likelihood of acute ischemia.\n\nAlthough typical characteristics increase the probability of CAD, atypical features do not exclude ACS. In the Multicenter Chest Pain Study, acute ischemia was diagnosed in 22% of patients who presented to the ED with sharp or stabbing pain and in 13% of those with pleuritic pain (110). Seven percent of patients whose pain was reproduced with palpation had ACS. The ACI-TIPI (Acute Cardiac Ischemia Time-Insensitive Predictive Instrument) project found that older age, male sex, chest or left arm pain, and chest pain or pressure were the most important findings, and each increased the likelihood of ACS (111,112).\n\nThe relief of chest pain with nitroglycerin is not predictive of ACS. One study reported that sublingual nitroglycerin relieved symptoms in 35% of patients with documented ACS compared with 41% of patients without ACS (113). The relief of chest pain by “gastrointestinal cocktails” (e.g., mixtures of liquid antacids, and/or viscous lidocaine, and/or anticholinergic agents) does not predict the absence of ACS (114).\n\nA prior history of MI is associated with a high risk of obstructive and multivessel CAD (115). Women with suspected ACS are less likely to have obstructive CAD than men. When obstructive CAD is present in women, it tends to be less severe than it is in men (116). It has been suggested that coronary microvascular disease and endothelial dysfunction play a role in the pathophysiology of NSTE-ACS in patients with nonobstructive CAD (116). Older adults have increased risks of underlying CAD (117,118), multivessel CAD, and a worse prognosis (Section 7.1).\n\nA family history of premature CAD is associated with increased coronary artery calcium scores (119) and increased risk of 30-day cardiac events in patients with ACS (120,121). Diabetes mellitus, extracardiac (carotid, aortic, or peripheral) arterial disease, and hypertension are major risk factors for poor outcomes in patients with ACS (Section 6.2) with both STEMI (122) and NSTE-ACS (92).\n\nThe current or prior use of aspirin at presentation is associated with increased cardiovascular risk (42), likely reflecting the greater probability that patients who have been prescribed aspirin have an increased cardiovascular risk profile and/or prior vascular disease. Smoking is associated with a lower risk of death in ACS (42,123,124), primarily because of the younger age of smokers with ACS and less severe CAD. Overweight and/or obesity at ACS presentation are associated with lower short-term risk of death. The “obesity paradox” may be a function of younger age at presentation, referral for angiography at an earlier stage of disease, and more aggressive management of ACS (123). These individuals, especially those with severe obesity (body mass index \u003e35), have a higher long-term total mortality risk (124–129).\n\nCocaine use can cause ACS by inducing coronary vasospasm, dissection, thrombosis, positive chronotropic and hypertensive actions, and direct myocardial toxicity (Section 7.10) (130). Methamphetamines are also associated with ACS (131). Urine toxicology screening should be considered when substance abuse is suspected as a cause of or contributor to ACS, especially in younger patients (\u003c50 years of age) (132).\n\nThe TIMI risk score is composed of 7, 1-point risk indicators rated on presentation (Table 3) (42). The composite endpoints increase as the score increases. The TIMI risk score has been validated internally within the TIMI 11B trial and in 2 separate cohorts of patients from the ESSENCE (Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non–Q-Wave Coronary Event) trial (133). The TIMI risk score calculator is available at www.timi.org. The TIMI risk index is useful in predicting 30-day and 1-year mortality in patients with NSTE-ACS (134). For patients with a TIMI risk score of 0 and normal high-sensitivity cardiac troponin 2 hours after presentation, accelerated diagnostic protocols have been developed that predict a very low rate of 30-day MACE (Section 3.4.3) (65).\n\nThe GRACE risk model predicts in-hospital and postdischarge mortality or MI (44,78,79,81). The GRACE tool was developed from 11,389 patients in GRACE and validated in subsequent GRACE and GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries) IIb cohorts. The sum of scores is applied to a reference nomogram to determine all-cause mortality from hospital discharge to 6 months. The GRACE clinical application tool is a web-based downloadable application available at http://www.outcomes-umassmed.org/grace/ (Figure 2) (44,135).\n\nAmong patients with a higher TIMI risk score (e.g., ≥3), there is a greater benefit from therapies such as low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) (133,136), platelet GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (137), and an invasive strategy (138). Similarly, the GRACE risk model can identify patients who would benefit from an early invasive strategy (139). Patients with elevated cardiac troponin benefit from more aggressive therapy, whereas those without elevated cardiac troponins may not (140). This is especially true for women in whom some data suggest adverse effects from invasive therapies in the absence of an elevated cardiac troponin value (141). Although B-type natriuretic peptide and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide are not useful for the diagnosis of ACS per se (but rather HF, which has many etiologies), they add prognostic value (87–91).\n\nThe 12-lead ECG is pivotal in the decision pathway for the evaluation and management of patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of ACS (58,59,85). Transient ST changes (≥0.5 mm [0.05 mV]) during symptoms at rest strongly suggest ischemia and underlying severe CAD. Patients without acute ischemic changes on ECG have a reduced risk of MI and a very low risk of in-hospital life-threatening complications, even in the presence of confounding electrocardiographic patterns such as LV hypertrophy (143–145). ST depression (especially horizontal or downsloping) is highly suggestive of NSTE-ACS (21,146,147). Marked symmetrical precordial T-wave inversion (≥2 mm [0.2 mV]) suggests acute ischemia, particularly due to a critical stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery (148,149); it may also be seen with acute pulmonary embolism and right-sided ST-T changes.\n\nNonspecific ST-T changes (usually defined as ST deviation of \u003c0.5 mm [0.05 mV] or T-wave inversion of \u003c2 mm [0.2 mV]) are less helpful diagnostically. Significant Q waves are less helpful, although by suggesting prior MI, they indicate a high likelihood of significant CAD. Isolated Q waves in lead 3 are a normal finding. A completely normal ECG in a patient with chest pain does not exclude ACS, because 1% to 6% of such patients will have a MI, and at least 4% will have UA (59–61). Fibrinolytic therapy is contraindicated for patients with ACS without ST-elevation, except for those with electrocardiographic evidence of true posterior MI (i.e., ST-elevation in posterior chest leads [V7 to V9]). This can be evaluated when acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is suspected but electrocardiographic changes are modest or not present (82–84); a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate for posterior wall motion abnormalities may also be helpful in this setting.\n\nAlternative causes of ST-T changes include LV aneurysm, pericarditis, myocarditis, bundle-branch block, LV hypertrophy, hyperkalemia, Prinzmetal angina, early repolarization, apical LV ballooning syndrome (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, Section 7.13), and Wolff-Parkinson-White conduction. Central nervous system events and therapy with tricyclic antidepressants or phenothiazines can cause deep T-wave inversion.\n\nThe physical examination is helpful in assessing the hemodynamic impact of an ischemic event. Patients with suspected ACS should have vital signs measured (BP in both arms if dissection is suspected) and should undergo a thorough cardiovascular examination. Patients with evidence of LV dysfunction on examination (e.g., rales, S3 gallop) or acute mitral regurgitation have a higher likelihood of severe underlying CAD and are at high risk of a poor outcome. In the SHOCK (Should we Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock) study, NSTEMI accounted for approximately 20% of cardiogenic shock complicating MI (150). Other trials have reported lower percentages (92,151). The physical examination may also help identify comorbid conditions (e.g., occult GI bleeding) that could impact therapeutic risk and decision making.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 2for additional information on risk stratification.\n\nSee Table 5 for a summary of recommendations from this section and Online Data Supplement 3 for additional information on cardiac injury markers and the universal definition of AMI.\n\nTable 5Summary of Recommendations for Cardiac Biomarkers and the Universal Definition of MI\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\n    Class I\n    1.Cardiac-specific troponin (troponin I or T when a contemporary assay is used) levels should be measured at presentation and 3 to 6 hours after symptom onset in all patients who present with symptoms consistent with ACS to identify a rising and/or falling pattern (21,64,67–71,152–156). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    2.Additional troponin levels should be obtained beyond 6 hours after symptom onset in patients with normal troponins on serial examination when electrocardiographic changes and/or clinical presentation confer an intermediate or high index of suspicion for ACS (21,72–74,157). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    3.If the time of symptom onset is ambiguous, the time of presentation should be considered the time of onset for assessing troponin values (67,68,72). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\n    Class III: No Benefit\n    1.With contemporary troponin assays, creatine kinase myocardial isoenzyme (CK-MB) and myoglobin are not useful for diagnosis of ACS (158–164). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\n    Class I\n    1.The presence and magnitude of troponin elevations are useful for short- and long-term prognosis (71,73,165,166). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.It may be reasonable to remeasure troponin once on day 3 or day 4 in patients with MI as an index of infarct size and dynamics of necrosis (164,165). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.Use of selected newer biomarkers, especially B-type natriuretic peptide, may be reasonable to provide additional prognostic information (87,88,167–171). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCardiac troponins are the mainstay for diagnosis of ACS and for risk stratification in patients with ACS. The primary diagnostic biomarkers of myocardial necrosis are cardiac troponin I and cardiac troponin T. Features that favor troponins for detection of ACS include high concentrations of troponins in the myocardium; virtual absence of troponins in nonmyocardial tissue; high-release ratio into the systemic circulation (amount found in blood relative to amount depleted from myocardium); rapid release into the blood in proportion to the extent of myocardial injury; and the ability to quantify values with reproducible, inexpensive, rapid, and easily applied assays. The 2012 Third Universal Definition of MI provides criteria that classify 5 clinical presentations of MI on the basis of pathological, clinical, and prognostic factors (21). In the appropriate clinical context, MI is indicated by a rising and/or falling pattern of troponin with ≥1 value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference level and evidence for serial increases or decreases in the levels of troponins (67,68,156). The potential consequences of emerging high-sensitivity troponin assays include increases in the diagnosis of NSTEMI (152,172,173) influenced by the definition of an abnormal troponin (67,153,174,175). The recommendations in this section are formulated from studies predicated on both the new European Society of Cardiology/ACC/AHA/World Health Organization criteria (21) and previous criteria/redefinitions of MI based on earlier-generation troponin assays (Appendix 4, Table A).\n\nSee Online Data Supplement 4 for additional information on cardiac troponins.\n\nOf the 3 troponin subunits, 2 subunits (troponin I and troponin T) are derived from genes specifically expressed in the myocardium. Cardiac troponin measurements provide highly sensitive results specific for detecting cardiomyocyte necrosis (34,173). Highly sensitive assays can identify cardiac troponin not only in the blood of patients with acute cardiac injury, but also in the blood of most healthy people (64,68,70,166,176,177). As assay sensitivity increases, a greater proportion of patients will have detectable long-term elevations in troponin, thus requiring consideration of serial changes for the diagnosis of MI. Clinicians should be aware of the sensitivity of the tests used for troponin evaluation in their hospitals and cutpoint concentrations for clinical decisions. Markedly elevated values are usually related to MI, myocarditis, rare analytical factors, or chronic elevations in patients with renal failure and in some patients with HF.\n\nCPGs endorse the 99th percentile of the upper reference level as the appropriate cutpoint for considering myocardial necrosis (21,22). For the diagnosis of acute myocardial necrosis, it is important to determine not only the peak troponin value, but also serial changes:\n\n    1.A troponin value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference level is required. Additionally, evidence for a serial increase or decrease ≥20% is required if the initial value is elevated (21,178).\n    2.For any troponin values below or close to the 99th percentile, evidence for acute myocardial necrosis is indicated by a change of ≥3 standard deviations of the variation around the initial value as determined by the individual laboratory (21,179).\n    3.Clinical laboratory reports should indicate whether significant changes in cardiac troponin values for the particular assay have occurred.\n\nAbsolute changes in nanograms per liter of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels appear to have a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy for AMI than relative changes and may distinguish AMI from other causes of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T elevations (71). This has also been suggested for some contemporary assays (71). Troponins are elevated in MI as early as 2 to 4 hours after symptom onset (64,70), and many medical centers obtain troponins at 3 hours. Depending on the assay, values may not become abnormal for up to 12 hours. In the vast majority of patients with symptoms suggestive of ACS, MI can be excluded or confirmed within 6 hours, because very few patients present immediately after symptom onset. In high-risk patients, measurements after 6 hours may be required to identify ACS.\n\nSolitary elevations of troponin cannot be assumed to be due to MI, because troponin elevations can be due to tachyarrhythmia, hypotension or hypertension, cardiac trauma, acute HF, myocarditis and pericarditis, acute pulmonary thromboembolic disease, and severe noncardiac conditions such as sepsis, burns, respiratory failure, acute neurological diseases, and drug toxicity (including cancer chemotherapy). Chronic elevations can result from structural cardiac abnormalities such as LV hypertrophy or ventricular dilatation and are also common in patients with renal insufficiency (34). Patients with end-stage renal disease and no clinical evidence of ACS frequently have elevations of cardiac troponin (180–182). With conventional assays, this is more common with cardiac troponin T than with cardiac troponin I (180). In the diagnosis of NSTEMI, cardiac troponin values must manifest an acute pattern consistent with the clinical events, including ischemic symptoms and electrocardiographic changes. Troponin elevations may persist for up to 14 days or occasionally longer. There is a paucity of guidelines for establishment of reinfarction during the acute infarct period on the basis of troponin measurements. References suggest that an increase of \u003e20% of previous troponin levels or an absolute increase of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T values (e.g., \u003e7 ng/L over 2 hours) may indicate reinfarction (183–185).\n\nDuring pregnancy, troponin values are within the normal range in the absence of cardiovascular morbidities. There is controversy as to whether troponin levels are elevated in pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, or gestational hypertension (186–189). When present, cardiac troponin elevations reflect myocardial necrosis.\n\nPoint-of-care troponin values may provide initial diagnostic information, although their sensitivity is substantially below that of central laboratory methods (154,155,190–192). In addition, the rigorous quantitative assay standardization needed for routine diagnosis favors central laboratory testing.\n\nTroponin elevations convey prognostic assessment beyond that of clinical information, the initial ECG, and the predischarge stress test (71). In addition, troponin elevations may provide information to direct therapy. Patients with cardiac troponin elevations are at high risk and benefit from intensive management and early revascularization (193–195). High risk is optimally defined by the changing pattern as described in Section 3.4.3. Cardiac troponin elevations correlate with estimation of infarct size and risk of death; persistent elevation 72 to 96 hours after symptom onset may afford relevant information in this regard (164). Elevations of cardiac troponin can occur for multiple reasons other than MI. In these cases, there is often substantial risk of adverse outcomes, as troponin elevation indicates cardiomyocyte necrosis (181).\n\nPreviously, CK-MB was used for early evidence of myocardial injury. Because myoglobin is a relatively small molecule, it is rapidly released from infarcted myocardium. CK-MB is much less sensitive for detection of myocardial injury than troponin, and substantially more tissue injury is required for its detection. With the availability of cardiac troponin, CK-MB, myoglobin, and other diagnostic biomarkers are no longer necessary (158,160–163,196–198). CK-MB may be used to estimate MI size. Detection of MI after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains an area of controversy. Because of the increased sensitivity of cardiac troponin, the prognostic value associated with varying degrees of elevation remains unclear.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplements 5, 6, and 7for additional information on cardiac injury markers.\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.It is reasonable to observe patients with symptoms consistent with ACS without objective evidence of myocardial ischemia (nonischemic initial ECG and normal cardiac troponin) in a chest pain unit or telemetry unit with serial ECGs and cardiac troponin at 3- to 6-hour intervals (196,197,199–201). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.It is reasonable for patients with possible ACS who have normal serial ECGs and cardiac troponins to have a treadmill ECG (200–202)(Level of Evidence: A), stress myocardial perfusion imaging (200), or stress echocardiography (203,204) before discharge or within 72 hours after discharge. (Level of Evidence: B)\n    3.In patients with possible ACS and a normal ECG, normal cardiac troponins, and no history of CAD, it is reasonable to initially perform (without serial ECGs and troponins) coronary CT angiography to assess coronary artery anatomy (205–207)(Level of Evidence: A) or rest myocardial perfusion imaging with a technetium-99m radiopharmaceutical to exclude myocardial ischemia (208,209). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    4.It is reasonable to give low-risk patients who are referred for outpatient testing daily aspirin, short-acting nitroglycerin, and other medication if appropriate (e.g., beta blockers), with instructions about activity level and clinician follow-up. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nThe majority of patients presenting to the ED with chest pain do not have ACS (Figure 1), and most are at low risk for major morbidity and mortality (35). Low-risk patients are usually identified by an absence of history of cardiovascular disease, normal or near-normal initial ECG, normal initial troponin, and clinical stability (35,202). The utility of an accelerated diagnostic protocol for detecting patients with benign conditions versus those who require admission for serious disease has been established (35). At minimum, these protocols involve serial ECGs and troponin measurements, both of which can be performed in the ED, a separate chest pain unit, or a telemetry unit. A 30-day negative predictive value \u003e99% for ACS has been reported for patients presenting to the ED with chest pain who undergo a 2-hour accelerated diagnostic protocol composed of a TIMI risk score of 0, normal ECG, and normal high-sensitivity troponin at 0 hours and 2 hours (assuming appropriate follow-up care) (65,210). Some protocols also call for a functional or anatomic test (e.g., treadmill test, rest scintigraphy, coronary CT angiography, stress imaging). Coronary CT angiography is associated with rapid assessment, high negative predictive value, decreased length of stay, and reduced costs (205–207); however, in the latter studies, it increased the rate of invasive coronary angiography and revascularization with uncertain long-term benefits in low-risk patients without ECG or troponin alterations (211). Accelerated diagnostic protocols are also potentially applicable in intermediate-risk patients, whose presentation includes a history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and/or advanced age (202).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 8for additional information on discharge from the ED or chest pain unit.\nEarly Hospital Care\n\nThe standard of care for patients who present with NSTE-ACS, including those with recurrent symptoms, ischemic electrocardiographic changes, or positive cardiac troponins, is admission for inpatient management. The goals of treatment are the immediate relief of ischemia and the prevention of MI and death. Initially, stabilized patients with NSTE-ACS are admitted to an intermediate (or step-down) care unit. Patients undergo continuous electrocardiographic rhythm monitoring and observation for recurrent ischemia. Bed or chair rest is recommended for patients admitted with NSTE-ACS. Patients with NSTE-ACS should be treated with antianginal (Section 4.1.2.5), antiplatelet, and anticoagulant therapy (Section 4.3). Patients are managed with either an early invasive strategy or an ischemia-guided strategy (Section 4.4).\n\nPatients with continuing angina, hemodynamic instability, uncontrolled arrhythmias, or a large MI should be admitted to a coronary care unit. The nurse-to-patient ratio should be sufficient to provide 1) continuous electrocardiographic rhythm monitoring, 2) frequent assessment of vital signs and mental status, and 3) ability to perform rapid cardioversion and defibrillation. These patients are usually observed in the coronary care unit for at least 24 hours. Those without recurrent ischemia, significant arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, or hemodynamic instability can be considered for admission or transfer to an intermediate care or telemetry unit.\n\nAn assessment of LV function is recommended because depressed LV function will likely influence pharmacological therapies (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors for depressed left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF]), may suggest the presence of more extensive CAD, and may influence the choice of revascularization (PCI versus coronary artery bypass graft surgery [CABG]). Because significant valvular disease may also influence the type of revascularization, echocardiography rather than ventriculography is often preferred for assessment of LV function.\n\nSee Table 6 for a summary of recommendations from this section.\n\nTable 6Summary of Recommendations for Early Hospital Care\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\n    Class I\n    1.Supplemental oxygen should be administered to patients with NSTE-ACS with arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%, respiratory distress, or other high-risk features of hypoxemia. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nPatients with cyanosis, arterial oxygen saturation \u003c90%, respiratory distress, or other high-risk features of hypoxemia are treated with supplemental oxygen. The 2007 UA/NSTEMI CPG recommended the routine administration of supplemental oxygen to all patients with NSTE-ACS during the first 6 hours after presentation on the premise that it is safe and may alleviate hypoxemia (212). The benefit of routine supplemental oxygen administration in normoxic patients with NSTE-ACS has never been demonstrated. At the time of GWC deliberations, data emerged that routine use of supplemental oxygen in cardiac patients may have untoward effects, including increased coronary vascular resistance, reduced coronary blood flow, and increased risk of mortality (213–215).\n\n    Class I\n    1.Patients with NSTE-ACS with continuing ischemic pain should receive sublingual nitroglycerin (0.3 mg to 0.4 mg) every 5 minutes for up to 3 doses, after which an assessment should be made about the need for intravenous nitroglycerin if not contraindicated (216–218). (Level of Evidence: C)\n    2.Intravenous nitroglycerin is indicated for patients with NSTE-ACS for the treatment of persistent ischemia, HF, or hypertension (219–224). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class III: Harm\n    1.Nitrates should not be administered to patients with NSTE-ACS who recently received a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, especially within 24 hours of sildenafil or vardenafil, or within 48 hours of tadalafil (225–227). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nNitrates are endothelium-independent vasodilators with peripheral and coronary vascular effects. By dilating the capacitance vessels, nitrates decrease cardiac preload and reduce ventricular wall tension. More modest effects on the arterial circulation result in afterload reduction and further decrease in MVO2. This may be partially offset by reflex increases in heart rate and contractility, which counteract the reduction in MVO2 unless a beta blocker is concurrently administered. Nitrates also dilate normal and atherosclerotic coronary arteries and increase coronary collateral flow. Nitrates may also inhibit platelet aggregation (228).\n\nRCTs have not shown a reduction in MACE with nitrates. The rationale for nitrate use in NSTE-ACS is extrapolated from pathophysiological principles and extensive (although uncontrolled) clinical observations, experimental studies, and clinical experience. The decision to administer nitrates should not preclude therapy with other proven mortality-reducing interventions such as beta blockers.\n\nIntravenous nitroglycerin is beneficial in patients with HF, hypertension, or symptoms that are not relieved with sublingual nitroglycerin and administration of a beta blocker (219,221–224). Patients who require intravenous nitroglycerin for \u003e24 hours may require periodic increases in the infusion rate and use of nontolerance-producing regimens (e.g., intermittent dosing) to maintain efficacy. In current practice, most patients who require continued intravenous nitroglycerin for the relief of angina undergo prompt coronary angiography and revascularization. Topical or oral nitrates are acceptable alternatives to intravenous nitroglycerin for patients who do not have refractory or recurrent ischemia (229,230). Side effects of nitrates include headache and hypotension. Nitrates should not be administered to patients with hypotension or to those who received a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and are administered with caution to patients with right ventricular infarction (231).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 9for additional information on nitrates.\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.In the absence of contraindications, it may be reasonable to administer morphine sulfate intravenously to patients with NSTE-ACS if there is continued ischemic chest pain despite treatment with maximally tolerated anti-ischemic medications (232,233). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class III: Harm\n    1.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (except aspirin) should not be initiated and should be discontinued during hospitalization for NSTE-ACS because of the increased risk of MACE associated with their use (234,235). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nThe role of morphine sulfate was re-evaluated for this CPG revision, including studies that suggest the potential for adverse events with its use (232). Morphine sulfate has potent analgesic and anxiolytic effects, as well as hemodynamic actions, that are potentially beneficial in NSTE-ACS. It causes venodilation and produces modest reductions in heart rate (through increased vagal tone) and systolic BP. In patients with symptoms despite antianginal treatment, morphine (1 mg to 5 mg IV) may be administered during intravenous nitroglycerin therapy with BP monitoring. The morphine dose may be repeated every 5 to 30 minutes to relieve symptoms and maintain the patient’s comfort. Its use should not preclude the use of other anti-ischemic therapies with proven benefits in patients with NSTE-ACS. To our knowledge, no RCTs have assessed the use of morphine in patients with NSTE-ACS or defined its optimal administration schedule. Observational studies have demonstrated increased adverse events associated with the use of morphine sulfate in patients with ACS and acute decompensated HF (232,233,236). Although these reports were observational, uncontrolled studies limited by selection bias, they raised important safety concerns.\n\nAlthough constipation, nausea, and/or vomiting occur in \u003e20% of patients, hypotension and respiratory depression are the most serious complications of excessive use of morphine. Naloxone (0.4 mg to 2.0 mg IV) may be administered for morphine overdose with respiratory or circulatory depression.\n\nTraditional NSAIDs and selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors markedly block endothelial prostacyclin production, which leads to unopposed platelet aggregation by platelet-derived thromboxane A2. Both types of NSAIDs prevent the beneficial actions of aspirin and interfere with the inhibition of COX-1, thromboxane A2 production, and platelet aggregation. Because of their inhibitory activity on the ubiquitous COXs, NSAIDs have an extensive adverse side effect profile, particularly renal and gastrointestinal. The increased cardiovascular hazards associated with NSAIDs have been observed in several studies of patients without ACS (234,235,237,238). The PRECISION (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Celecoxib Integrated Safety Versus Ibuprofen Or Naproxen) trial, in progress at the time of publication, is the first study of patients with high cardiovascular risk who are receiving long-term treatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor or traditional NSAIDs. PRECISION will examine the relative cardiovascular safety profiles of celecoxib, ibuprofen, and naproxen in patients without ACS (239).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 10for additional information on analgesic therapy.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Oral beta-blocker therapy should be initiated within the first 24 hours in patients who do not have any of the following: 1) signs of HF, 2) evidence of low-output state, 3) increased risk for cardiogenic shock, or 4) other contraindications to beta blockade (e.g., PR interval \u003e0.24 second, second- or third-degree heart block without a cardiac pacemaker, active asthma, or reactive airway disease) (240–242). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    2.In patients with concomitant NSTE-ACS, stabilized HF, and reduced systolic function, it is recommended to continue beta-blocker therapy with 1 of the 3 drugs proven to reduce mortality in patients with HF: sustained-release metoprolol succinate, carvedilol, or bisoprolol. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    3.Patients with documented contraindications to beta blockers in the first 24 hours of NSTE-ACS should be re-evaluated to determine their subsequent eligibility. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.It is reasonable to continue beta-blocker therapy in patients with normal LV function with NSTE-ACS (241,243). (Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class III: Harm\n    1.Administration of intravenous beta blockers is potentially harmful in patients with NSTE-ACS who have risk factors for shock (244). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nBeta blockers decrease heart rate, contractility, and BP, resulting in decreased MVO2. Beta blockers without increased sympathomimetic activity should be administered orally in the absence of contraindications. Although early administration does not reduce short-term mortality (241,244), beta blockers decrease myocardial ischemia, reinfarction, and the frequency of complex ventricular dysrhythmias (240,245), and they increase long-term survival. Early beta blockade, particularly if given intravenously, can increase the likelihood of shock in patients with risk factors. Risk factors for shock include patients \u003e70 years of age, heart rate \u003e110 beats per minute, systolic BP \u003c120 mm Hg, and late presentation (244). In patients with LV dysfunction (LVEF \u003c0.40) with or without pulmonary congestion, beta blockers are strongly recommended before discharge. Beta blockers should be used prudently with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with HF. Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blocking agents should be cautiously added in patients with decompensated HF (246). Beta blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity should be used, especially beta-1 blockers such as sustained-release metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol, or carvedilol, a beta-1 and alpha-1 blocker. This is because of their mortality benefit in patients with HF and systolic dysfunction (246,247). In patients with chronic obstructive lung disease or a history of asthma, beta blockers are not contraindicated in the absence of active bronchospasm. Beta-1 selective beta blockers are preferred and should be initiated at a low dosage.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 11for additional information on beta blockers, including risk factors for shock.\n\n    Class I\n    1.In patients with NSTE-ACS, continuing or frequently recurring ischemia, and a contraindication to beta blockers, a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) (e.g., verapamil or diltiazem) should be given as initial therapy in the absence of clinically significant LV dysfunction, increased risk for cardiogenic shock, PR interval greater than 0.24 second, or second- or third-degree atrioventricular block without a cardiac pacemaker (248–250). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.Oral nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists are recommended in patients with NSTE-ACS who have recurrent ischemia in the absence of contraindications, after appropriate use of beta blockers and nitrates. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    3.CCBs†\n\n    † †Short-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists should be avoided.\n    are recommended for ischemic symptoms when beta blockers are not successful, are contraindicated, or cause unacceptable side effects. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    4.Long-acting CCBs and nitrates are recommended in patients with coronary artery spasm. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class III: Harm\n    1.Immediate-release nifedipine should not be administered to patients with NSTE-ACS in the absence of beta-blocker therapy (251,252). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCCBs include dihydropyridines and nondihydropyridines. The dihydropyridines (nifedipine and amlodipine) produce the most marked peripheral vasodilation and have little direct effect on contractility, atrioventricular conduction, and heart rate. The nondihydropyridines (diltiazem and verapamil) have significant negative inotropic actions and negative chronotropic and dromotropic effects. All CCBs cause similar coronary vasodilation and are preferred in vasospastic angina (253). They also alleviate ischemia due to obstructive CAD by decreasing heart rate and BP. Verapamil and diltiazem decreased reinfarction in patients without LV dysfunction in some (248,249,254) but not all studies (255,256). Verapamil may be beneficial in reducing long-term events after AMI in hypertensive patients without LV dysfunction (250) and in patients with MI and HF receiving an ACE inhibitor (257). Immediate-release nifedipine causes a dose-related increase in mortality in patients with CAD and harm in ACS and is not recommended for routine use in patients with ACS (251,258). Long-acting preparations may be useful in older patients with systolic hypertension (259). There are no significant trial data on efficacy of amlodipine or felodipine in patients with NSTE-ACS.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 12for additional information on CCBs.\n\nRanolazine\n\nRanolazine is an antianginal medication with minimal effects on heart rate and BP (260,261). It inhibits the late inward sodium current and reduces the deleterious effects of intracellular sodium and calcium overload that accompany myocardial ischemia (262). Ranolazine is currently indicated for treatment of chronic angina. The MERLIN-TIMI (Metabolic Efficiency With Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non–ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes-Thrombosis In Myocardial Infarction) 36 trial examined the efficacy and safety of ranolazine in 6,560 patients with NSTE-ACS who presented within 48 hours of ischemic symptoms (263). In a post hoc analysis in women, ranolazine was associated with a reduced incidence of the primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, MI, or recurrent ischemia), principally owing to a 29% reduction in recurrent ischemia (116). In the subgroup with prior chronic angina (n=3,565), ranolazine was associated with a lower primary composite endpoint, a significant reduction of worsening angina, and increased exercise duration (264). Because the primary endpoint of the original MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial was not met, all additional analyses should be interpreted with caution. The recommended initial dose is 500 mg orally twice daily, which can be uptitrated to a maximum of 1,000 mg orally twice daily. Ranolazine is usually well tolerated; its major adverse effects are constipation, nausea, dizziness, and headache. Ranolazine prolongs the QTc interval in a dose-related manner, but QTc prolongation requiring dose reduction was comparable with ranolazine and placebo in the MERLIN-TIMI 36 trial (263).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 13for additional information on ranolazine.\n\nIntra-Aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) Counterpulsation\n\nIABP counterpulsation may be used in patients with NSTE-ACS to treat severe persistent or recurrent ischemia, especially in patients awaiting invasive angiography and revascularization, despite intensive medical therapy. In experimental studies, IABP counterpulsation increases diastolic BP and coronary blood flow and potentially augments cardiac output while diminishing LV end-diastolic pressure. The use of IABP for refractory ischemia dates back several decades, and its current application is predominantly driven by clinical experience and nonrandomized observational studies (265). When studied in rigorous RCTs, IABP counterpulsation failed to reduce MACE in high-risk elective PCI (266), decrease infarct size after primary PCI for acute STEMI (267), or diminish early mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock complicating AMI (268).\n\n    Class I\n    1.High-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued in all patients with NSTE-ACS and no contraindications to its use (269–273). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.It is reasonable to obtain a fasting lipid profile in patients with NSTE-ACS, preferably within 24 hours of presentation. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nTherapy with statins in patients with NSTE-ACS reduces the rate of recurrent MI, coronary heart disease mortality, need for myocardial revascularization, and stroke. High-risk patients, such as those with NSTE-ACS, derive more benefit in reducing these events from high-intensity statins, such as atorvastatin which lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by ≥50% as in the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) and MIRACL (Myocardial Ischemia Reduction With Acute Cholesterol Lowering) trials (273,274), than from moderate- or low-intensity statins (18,272). These findings provide the basis for high-intensity statin therapy after stabilization of patients with NSTE-ACS. In addition, early introduction of this approach can promote improved compliance with this regimen.\n\n    Class I\n    1.ACE inhibitors should be started and continued indefinitely in all patients with LVEF less than 0.40 and in those with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or stable CKD (Section 7.6), unless contraindicated (275,276). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    2.ARBs are recommended in patients with HF or MI with LVEF less than 0.40 who are ACE inhibitor intolerant (277,278). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    3.Aldosterone blockade is recommended in patients post–MI without significant renal dysfunction (creatinine \u003e2.5 mg/dL in men or \u003e2.0 mg/dL in women) or hyperkalemia (K+ \u003e5.0 mEq/L) who are receiving therapeutic doses of ACE inhibitor and beta blocker and have a LVEF 0.40 or less, diabetes mellitus, or HF (279). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.ARBs are reasonable in other patients with cardiac or other vascular disease who are ACE inhibitor intolerant (280). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.ACE inhibitors may be reasonable in all other patients with cardiac or other vascular disease (281,282). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nACE inhibitors reduce mortality in patients with recent MI, primarily those with LV dysfunction (LVEF \u003c0.40) with or without pulmonary congestion (283–285). In patients with normal LV function (including patients with diabetes mellitus), total mortality and MACE (including HF) are reduced. It has been found that approximately 15% of patients with NSTEMI develop HF during hospitalization, with the rate increasing to 24% of patients 1 year later (286). A meta-analysis demonstrated a small but significant (0.48%) absolute benefit of early initiation of an ACE inhibitor on survival at 30 days, with benefit seen as early as 24 hours after admission for AMI (283). An ACE inhibitor should be used cautiously in the first 24 hours of AMI, because it may result in hypotension or renal dysfunction (283). It may be prudent to initially use a short-acting ACE inhibitor, such as captopril or enalapril, in patients at increased risk of these adverse events. In patients with significant renal dysfunction, it is sensible to stabilize renal function before initiating an ACE inhibitor or an ARB, with re-evaluation of creatinine levels after drug initiation. An ARB may be substituted for an ACE inhibitor with similar benefits on survival (277,278). Combining an ACE inhibitor and an ARB may result in an increase in adverse events (277,278). In a study in which patients with AMI with LV dysfunction (LVEF \u003c0.40) with or without HF were randomized 3 to 14 days after AMI to receive eplerenone (a selective aldosterone blocker), eplerenone was efficacious as an adjunct to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers in decreasing long-term mortality (279,287). In a study of patients with HF, \u003e50% of whom had an ischemic etiology, spironolactone (a nonselective aldosterone inhibitor) was beneficial (279); however, RCT data on MI are not available.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 14for additional information on inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\nSee Table 7 for a summary of recommendations from this section and Online Data Supplement 15 for additional information on initial oral and intravenous antiplatelet therapy in patients with definite or likely NSTE-ACS treated with an early invasive or an ischemia-guided strategy.\n\n    Class I‡\n\n    ‡ See Section 5.1.2.1 for recommendations at the time of PCI.\n    1.Non–enteric-coated, chewable aspirin (162 mg to 325 mg) should be given to all patients with NSTE-ACS without contraindications as soon as possible after presentation, and a maintenance dose of aspirin (81 mg/d to 325 mg/d) should be continued indefinitely (288–290,293,391). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    2.In patients with NSTE-ACS who are unable to take aspirin because of hypersensitivity or major gastrointestinal intolerance, a loading dose of clopidogrel followed by a daily maintenance dose should be administered (291). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    3.A P2Y12 inhibitor (either clopidogrel or ticagrelor) in addition to aspirin should be administered for up to 12 months to all patients with NSTE-ACS without contraindications who are treated with either an early invasive§\n\n    § §See Section 4.3.1.2 for prasugrel indications in either an early invasive or ischemia-guided strategy.\n    or ischemia-guided strategy. Options include:\n        •Clopidogrel: 300-mg or 600-mg loading dose, then 75 mg daily (289,292)(Level of Evidence: B)\n        •Ticagrelor‖\n\n        ‖ ‖The recommended maintenance dose of aspirin to be used with ticagrelor is 81 mg daily (290).\n        : 180-mg loading dose, then 90 mg twice daily (293,294)(Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.It is reasonable to use ticagrelor in preference to clopidogrel for P2Y12 treatment in patients with NSTE-ACS who undergo an early invasive or ischemia-guided strategy (293,294). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.In patients with NSTE-ACS treated with an early invasive strategy and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with intermediate/high-risk features (e.g., positive troponin), a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor may be considered as part of initial antiplatelet therapy. Preferred options are eptifibatide or tirofiban (43,94,295). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nDespite the large number of new antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents, aspirin, which targets COX and subsequent thromboxane A2 inhibition, is the mainstay of antiplatelet therapy. Multiple other pathways of platelet activation can be targeted by agents that inhibit the platelet P2Y12 receptor, including thienopyridine prodrug agents, such as clopidogrel and prasugrel, which require conversion into molecules that bind irreversibly to the P2Y12 receptor. Additional pyrimidine derivatives, including ticagrelor, do not require biotransformation and bind reversibly to the P2Y12 receptor, antagonizing adenosine diphosphate platelet activation. In addition to these oral agents, intravenous GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors, including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban, target the final common pathway of platelet aggregation. In the EARLY ACS (Early Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibition in Patients With Non–ST-Segment Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome) trial, patients were randomly assigned to either early, pre–PCI double-bolus eptifibatide or delayed, provisional eptifibatide. Seventy-five percent of the patients received upstream, preprocedure clopidogrel. The risk of TIMI major bleeding in the early eptifibatide group was 2.6% compared with 1.8% (p=0.02) in the delayed provisional group (295). In the GUSTO IV-ACS (Global Use of Strategies To Open Occluded Coronary Arteries IV-Acute Coronary Syndromes) trial, there was no clinical benefit of abciximab in this population; in troponin-negative patients, mortality was 8.5% compared with 5.8% in controls (p=0.002) (288,289,296,297).\n\nTable 7Summary of Recommendations for Initial Antiplatelet/Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Definite or Likely NSTE-ACS and PCI\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nAspirin is the established first-line therapy in patients with NSTE-ACS and reduces the incidence of recurrent MI and death (288,289). A loading dose of non–enteric-coated aspirin 162 mg to 325 mg is the initial antiplatelet therapy. The subsequent maintenance dose is 81 mg per day to 162 mg per day; in special circumstances, a higher maintenance dose up to 325 mg daily has been used (391). The lower dose is favored and all patients treated with ticagrelor should receive only 81 mg per day (290). In other countries, available low-dose aspirin formations may include 75 mg and 100 mg. High-dose (≥160 mg) versus low-dose (\u003c160 mg) aspirin is associated with increased bleeding risk in the absence of improved outcomes (298). Most NSAIDs reversibly bind to COX-1, preventing inhibition by aspirin and by COX-2 and may cause prothrombotic effects. Enteric-coated aspirin should be avoided initially because of its delayed and reduced absorption (299).\n\nThree P2Y12 receptor inhibitors are approved in the United States for treatment of ischemic myocardial disorders, including NSTE-ACS. For discontinuation before surgery, see Section 5.\n\nClopidogrel\n\nAdministration of clopidogrel with aspirin was superior to administration of aspirin alone in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular death and nonfatal MI or stroke both acutely and over the following 11 months (289,296). There was a slight increase in major bleeding events with clopidogrel, including a nonsignificant increase in life-threatening bleeding and fatal bleeding (289). An initial loading dose of 300 mg to 600 mg is recommended (289,296,300). A 600-mg loading dose results in a greater, more rapid, and more reliable platelet inhibition compared with a 300-mg loading dose (301). Use of clopidogrel for patients with NSTE-ACS who are aspirin intolerant is based on a study in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (291). When possible, discontinue clopidogrel at least 5 days before surgery (301).\n\nPrasugrel\n\nThe metabolic conversion pathways of prasugrel produce more rapid and consistent platelet inhibition than clopidogrel (300). In patients with NSTE-ACS and defined coronary anatomy undergoing planned PCI, a 60-mg loading dose of prasugrel followed by 10 mg daily was compared with a 300-mg loading dose and 75 mg daily of clopidogrel. The composite primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and stroke) was reduced in patients treated with prasugrel (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.81; p=0.001). This was driven by a risk reduction for MI and stent thrombosis with no difference in mortality (302). Counterbalancing the salutary effects of prasugrel was a significant increase in spontaneous bleeding, life-threatening bleeding, and fatal bleeding in the patients treated with prasugrel compared with patients treated with clopidogrel. There was net harm in patients with a history of cerebrovascular events and no clinical benefit in patients \u003e75 years of age or those with low body weight (\u003c60 kg) (302). In patients with NSTE-ACS treated with an ischemia-guided strategy, 1 RCT comparing aspirin and either clopidogrel or prasugrel evaluated the primary endpoint of death from cardiovascular causes, MI, or stroke for up to 30 months; there were similar bleeding rates and no benefit of treatment with prasugrel when compared with treatment with clopidogrel (303). The ACCOAST (A Comparison of Prasugrel at the Time of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or as Pretreatment at the Time of Diagnosis in Patients With Non–ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction) RCT of high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS scheduled to undergo early coronary angiography found that a strategy of administration of prasugrel at the time of randomization before angiography did not lead to a reduction in the composite primary endpoint when compared with a strategy of administration of prasugrel only at the time of PCI; however, it did lead to an increase in bleeding complications (304). On the basis of TRITON (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel) study design and the results of TRILOGY ACS (Targeted Platelet Inhibition to Clarify the Optimal Strategy to Medically Manage Acute Coronary Syndromes) and ACCOAST, prasugrel is not recommended for “upfront” therapy in patients with NSTE-ACS. The use of prasugrel in patients undergoing PCI is addressed in Section 5.\n\nTicagrelor\n\nTicagrelor is an oral, reversibly binding P2Y12 inhibitor with a relatively short plasma half-life (12 hours). Compared with clopidogrel, ticagrelor has a more rapid and consistent onset of action and, because it is reversible, it has a faster recovery of platelet function. The loading dose of ticagrelor for patients treated either invasively or with an ischemia-guided strategy is 180 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 90 mg twice daily (293,294). In patients with NSTE-ACS treated with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel, there was a reduction in the composite outcome of death from vascular causes, MI, or stroke (reduction: 11.7% to 9.8%; HR: 0.84; p\u003c0.001) (293). The mortality rate was also lower in those patients treated with ticagrelor. Although overall major bleeding was not increased with ticagrelor, a modest increase in major bleeding and non–procedure-related bleeding occurred in the subgroup of patients who did not undergo CABG (major bleeding: 4.5% versus 3.8%; p=0.02; nonprocedure major bleeding: 3.1% versus 2.3%; p=0.05); however, there was no difference in blood transfusion or fatal bleeding (305). Side effects unique to ticagrelor include dyspnea (which occurs in up to 15% of patients within the first week of treatment but is rarely severe enough to cause discontinuation of treatment) (293) and bradycardia. The benefit of ticagrelor over clopidogrel was limited to patients taking 75 mg to 100 mg of aspirin (290). The short half-life requires twice-daily administration, which could potentially result in adverse events in noncompliant patients, particularly after stent implantation. When possible, ticagrelor should be discontinued at least 5 days before surgery (306). Although ticagrelor has not been studied in the absence of aspirin, its use in aspirin-intolerant patients is a reasonable alternative.\n\nIntravenous GP IIb/IIIa Receptor Inhibitors\n\nThe small molecule GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, tirofiban and eptifibatide, bind reversibly to the GP IIb/IIIa receptor. Because the drug-to-receptor ratio is high, platelet infusion is not effective in cases of severe bleeding after use of eptifibatide or tirofiban, and they must be cleared from the circulation to reduce bleeding. In contrast, with abciximab, the drug-to-receptor ratio is low, and platelet infusion may be effective.\n\nSeveral large RCTs evaluated the impact of GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors in patients with NSTE-ACS who were committed to an invasive strategy (295,296,306). The ACUITY (Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy) trial evaluated unfractionated heparin (UFH) versus bivalirudin with or without GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (295,307). The rates of composite ischemia (death, MI, unplanned revascularization) in patients who received bivalirudin alone compared with those who received UFH plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were similar (9% versus 8%; p=0.45) (307). Fewer patients experienced major bleeding with bivalirudin alone than did with heparin plus GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (4% versus 7%; relative risk [RR]: 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.40 to 0.66; p\u003c0.0001) (307). The ACUITY Timing trial evaluated the benefit of upstream GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist compared with its deferred use, testing the hypothesis that earlier administration of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients destined for PCI would be superior (308). Composite ischemia at 30 days occurred in 7.9% of patients assigned to deferred use compared with 7.1% assigned to upstream administration (RR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.97 to 1.29; p=0.044 for noninferiority; p=0.13 for superiority). Deferred GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduced the 30-day rates of major bleeding compared with upstream use (4.9% versus 6.1%; p\u003c0.001) (308). Similar results were reported by the EARLY ACS investigators, who evaluated eptifibatide given upstream versus delayed, provisional administration in \u003e9,000 patients with NSTE-ACS (295). The composite endpoint of death, MI, recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization, or thrombotic complications occurred in 9.3% of patients in the early-eptifibatide group compared with 10% in the delayed-eptifibatide group (odds ratio [OR]: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.06; p=0.23) (308). As in the ACUITY Timing trial, the early-eptifibatide group had significantly higher rates of bleeding and red cell transfusions (295,308).\n\nSee Table 7 for a summary of recommendations regarding antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy in patients with definite or likely NSTE-ACS and Online Data Supplement 16 for additional information on combined oral anticoagulant therapy and antiplatelet therapy in patients with definite NSTE-ACS.\n\n    Class I‡\n\n    ‡ See Section 5.1.2.1 for recommendations at the time of PCI.\n    1.In patients with NSTE-ACS, anticoagulation, in addition to antiplatelet therapy, is recommended for all patients irrespective of initial treatment strategy. Treatment options include:\n        •Enoxaparin: 1 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) every 12 hours (reduce dose to 1 mg/kg SC once daily in patients with creatinine clearance [CrCl] \u003c30 mL/min), continued for the duration of hospitalization or until PCI is performed. An initial intravenous loading dose of 30 mg has been used in selected patients (133,136,309). (Level of Evidence: A)\n        •Bivalirudin: 0.10 mg/kg loading dose followed by 0.25 mg/kg per hour (only in patients managed with an early invasive strategy), continued until diagnostic angiography or PCI, with only provisional use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, provided the patient is also treated with DAPT (292,293,310,311). (Level of Evidence: B)\n        •Fondaparinux: 2.5 mg SC daily, continued for the duration of hospitalization or until PCI is performed (312–314). (Level of Evidence: B)\n        •If PCI is performed while the patient is on fondaparinux, an additional anticoagulant with anti-IIa activity (either UFH or bivalirudin) should be administered because of the risk of catheter thrombosis (313–315). (Level of Evidence: B)\n        •UFH IV: initial loading dose of 60 IU/kg (maximum 4,000 IU) with initial infusion of 12 IU/kg per hour (maximum 1,000 IU/h) adjusted per activated partial thromboplastin time to maintain therapeutic anticoagulation according to the specific hospital protocol, continued for 48 hours or until PCI is performed (316–322). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nLMWHs have a molecular weight approximately one third that of UFH and have balanced anti-Xa and anti-IIa activity. LMWHs are readily absorbed after subcutaneous administration and have less platelet activation (323). The anticoagulant activity of LMWH does not require routine monitoring. The dose of enoxaparin is 1 mg/kg SC every 12 hours for NSTE-ACS; an initial intravenous loading dose of 30 mg has been used in selected patients. In the presence of impaired renal function (CrCl \u003c30 mL per minute), which is a common finding in older patients, the dose should be reduced to 1 mg/kg SC once daily, and strong consideration should be given to UFH as an alternative. Calculation of CrCl is prudent in patients considered for enoxaparin therapy.\n\nIn the ESSENCE trial, in patients with UA or non–Q-wave MI, the rates of recurrent ischemic events and invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were significantly reduced by enoxaparin therapy in the short term, and benefit was sustained at 1 year (324).\n\nIn the SYNERGY (Superior Yield of the New Strategy of Enoxaparin, Revascularization and Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors) trial of high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS treated with an early invasive strategy, there was no significant difference in death or MI at 30 days between those randomized to enoxaparin versus UFH. There was more TIMI major bleeding in those treated with enoxaparin without statistically significant increase in GUSTO severe bleeding or transfusion. Some of the increased bleeding may have been related to patients randomized to enoxaparin who received additional UFH at the time of PCI (325,326).\n\nThe direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin is administered intravenously. Bivalirudin was evaluated in the ACUITY trial, a randomized open-label trial, in 13,819 moderate- to high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS with a planned invasive strategy. Three treatment arms were tested, including UFH or LMWH with a GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor, bivalirudin with a GP IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor, or bivalirudin alone. The majority of patients received clopidogrel (300 mg) before intervention, in addition to aspirin, anticoagulants, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors. Bivalirudin alone was noninferior to the standard UFH/LMWH combined with GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (composite ischemia endpoint 7.8% versus 7.3%; HR: 1.08; p=0.32), but there was a significantly lower rate of major bleeding with bivalirudin (3.0% versus 5.7%; HR: 0.53; p\u003c0.001) (310). The anticoagulant effect of bivalirudin can be monitored in the catheterization laboratory by the activated clotting time.\n\nFondaparinux is a synthetic polysaccharide molecule and the only selective inhibitor of activated factor X available for clinical use. Fondaparinux is well absorbed when given subcutaneously and has a half-life of 17 hours, enabling once-daily administration. Because it is excreted by the kidneys, it is contraindicated if CrCl is \u003c30 mL per minute. Monitoring of anti-Xa activity is not required, and fondaparinux does not affect usual anticoagulant parameters such as activated partial thromboplastin time or activated clotting time. In NSTE-ACS, the dose of fondaparinux is 2.5 mg SC administered daily and continued for the duration of hospitalization or until PCI is performed (312–314). In the OASIS (Organization to Assess Strategies in Ischemic Syndromes)-5 study, patients with NSTE-ACS were randomized to receive 2.5 mg SC fondaparinux daily or enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC twice daily for 8 days. The incidence of the primary composite ischemic endpoint at 9 days was similar between fondaparinux and enoxaparin, but major bleeding was significantly less frequent with fondaparinux. To avert catheter thrombosis when fondaparinux is used alone in patients undergoing PCI, an anticoagulant with anti-IIa activity is also administered (313–315). One regimen is 85 IU/kg of UFH loading dose at the time of PCI (reduced to 60 IU/kg if a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor is used concomitantly) (314).\n\nStudies supporting the addition of a parenteral anticoagulant to aspirin in patients with NSTE-ACS were performed primarily on patients with a diagnosis of “unstable angina” in the era before DAPT and early catheterization and revascularization. In general, those studies found a strong trend for reduction in composite adverse events with the addition of parenteral UFH to aspirin therapy (316–322).\n\nClinical trials indicate that a weight-adjusted dosing regimen of UFH can provide more predictable anticoagulation (327) than a fixed initial dose (e.g., 5,000 IU loading dose, 1,000 IU/h initial infusion). The recommended weight-adjusted regimen is an initial loading dose of 60 IU/kg (maximum 4,000 IU) and an initial infusion of 12 IU/kg/h (maximum 1,000 IU/h), adjusted using a standardized nomogram.\n\nArgatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is indicated for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, including those undergoing PCI (328). Steady state plasma concentrations are achieved in 1 to 3 hours after intravenous administration. Because of its hepatic metabolism, argatroban can be used in patients with renal insufficiency. The usual dose is 2 mcg/kg per minute by continuous intravenous infusion, adjusted to maintain the activated partial thromboplastin time at 1.5 to 3 times baseline (but not \u003e100 s).\n\n    Class III: Harm\n    1.In patients with NSTE-ACS (i.e., without ST-elevation, true posterior MI, or left bundle-branch block not known to be old), intravenous fibrinolytic therapy should not be used (93,329). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\nThere is no role for fibrinolytic therapy in patients with NSTE-ACS. Fibrinolysis with or without subsequent PCI in patients with NSTE-ACS was evaluated by the Fibrinolytic Trialists and TIMI investigators (93,329). There was no benefit for mortality or MI. Intracranial hemorrhage and fatal and nonfatal MI occurred more frequently in patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 17for additional information on parenteral anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapy in patients with definite NSTE-ACS.\n\nSee Figure 3 for the management algorithm for ischemia-guided versus early invasive strategy.\n\nFigure 3\n\nFigure 3\n\nAlgorithm for Management of Patients With Definite or Likely NSTE-ACS*\n\n*See corresponding full-sentence recommendations and their explanatory footnotes.\n\n†In patients who have been treated with fondaparinux (as upfront therapy) who are undergoing PCI, an additional anticoagulant with anti-IIa activity should be administered at the time of PCI because of the risk of catheter thrombosis.\n\nASA indicates aspirin; CABG, coronary artery bypass graft; cath, catheter; COR, Class of Recommendation; DAPT, dual antiplatelet therapy; GPI, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor; LOE, Level of Evidence; NSTE-ACS, non–ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention; pts, patients; and UFH, unfractionated heparin.\n\nImage not available.\nView Large  | Download Slide (.ppt) | View in Article Context\n\nTwo treatment pathways have emerged for all patients with NSTE-ACS. The invasive strategy triages patients to an invasive diagnostic evaluation (i.e., coronary angiography). In contrast, the initial ischemia-guided strategy calls for an invasive evaluation for those patients who 1) fail medical therapy (refractory angina or angina at rest or with minimal activity despite vigorous medical therapy), 2) have objective evidence of ischemia (dynamic electrocardiographic changes, myocardial perfusion defect) as identified on a noninvasive stress test, or 3) have clinical indicators of very high prognostic risk (e.g., high TIMI or GRACE scores). In both strategies, patients should receive optimal anti-ischemic and antithrombotic medical therapy as outlined in Section 4.1. A subgroup of patients with refractory ischemic symptoms or hemodynamic or rhythm instability are candidates for urgent coronary angiography and revascularization.\n\nThis strategy seeks to rapidly risk stratify patients by assessing their coronary anatomy. The major advantages of invasive therapy when appropriate are 1) the rapid and definitive nature of the evaluation, 2) the potential for earlier revascularization in appropriate patients that might prevent occurrence of further complications of ACS that could ensue during medical therapy, and 3) facilitation of earlier discharge from a facility.\n\nThe optimal timing of angiography has not been conclusively defined. In general, 2 options have emerged: early invasive (i.e., within 24 hours) or delayed invasive (i.e., within 25 to 72 hours). In most studies using the invasive strategy, angiography was deferred for 12 to 72 hours while antithrombotic and anti-ischemic therapies were intensified (138,332–337). The concept of deferred angiography espouses that revascularization may be safer once plaque is stabilized with optimal antithrombotic and/or anti-ischemic therapies. Conversely, early angiography facilitates earlier risk stratification and consequently speeds revascularization and discharge but can place greater logistic demands on a healthcare system.\n\nThe ischemia-guided strategy seeks to avoid the routine early use of invasive procedures unless patients experience refractory or recurrent ischemic symptoms or develop hemodynamic instability. When the ischemia-guided strategy is chosen, a plan for noninvasive evaluation is required to detect severe ischemia that occurs at a low threshold of stress and to promptly refer these patients for coronary angiography and revascularization as indicated. The major advantage offered by the ischemia-guided strategy is that some patients’ conditions stabilize during medical therapy and will not require coronary angiography and revascularization. Consequently, the ischemia-guided strategy may potentially avoid costly and possibly unnecessary invasive procedures.\n\n    Class I\n    1.An urgent/immediate invasive strategy (diagnostic angiography with intent to perform revascularization if appropriate based on coronary anatomy) is indicated in patients (men and women¶\n\n    ¶ ¶See Section 7.7 for additional information on women.\n    ) with NSTE-ACS who have refractory angina or hemodynamic or electrical instability (without serious comorbidities or contraindications to such procedures) (42,44,138,338). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    2.An early invasive strategy (diagnostic angiography with intent to perform revascularization if appropriate based on coronary anatomy) is indicated in initially stabilized patients with NSTE-ACS (without serious comorbidities or contraindications to such procedures) who have an elevated risk for clinical events (Table 8) (42,44,138,333,334,338,339). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.It is reasonable to choose an early invasive strategy (within 24 hours of admission) over a delayed invasive strategy (within 25 to 72 hours) for initially stabilized high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS. For those not at high/intermediate risk, a delayed invasive approach is reasonable (139). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.In initially stabilized patients, an ischemia-guided strategy may be considered for patients with NSTE-ACS (without serious comorbidities or contraindications to this approach) who have an elevated risk for clinical events (333,334,338).

(Level of Evidence: C)\n        b.Acute chest pain and a low likelihood of ACS who are troponin-negative (Level of Evidence: C), especially women (141). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nSeveral studies (93,138,334–337) and meta-analyses (141,340) have concluded that a strategy of routine invasive therapy is generally superior to an ischemia-guided strategy or selectively invasive approach. One study reported that the routine invasive strategy resulted in an 18% relative reduction in death or MI, including a significant reduction in MI alone (341). The routine invasive arm was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (1.8% versus 1.1%), but this disadvantage was more than compensated for by a significant reduction in mortality between discharge and the end of follow-up (3.8% versus 4.9%). The invasive strategy was also associated with less angina and fewer rehospitalizations. Patients undergoing routine invasive treatment also had improved quality of life. In an analysis of individual patient data (340) that reported 5-year outcomes from the FRISC (Framingham and Fast Revascularization During Instability in Coronary Artery Disease)-II trial (339), ICTUS (Invasive Versus Conservative Treatment in Unstable Coronary Syndromes) trial (338), and RITA (Randomized Trial of a Conservative Treatment Strategy Versus an Interventional Treatment Strategy in Patients with Unstable Angina)-3 trial (334), 14.7% of patients (389 of 2,721) randomized to a routine invasive strategy experienced cardiovascular death or nonfatal MI versus 17.9% of patients (475 of 2,746) in the selective invasive strategy (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.93; p=0.002). The most marked treatment effect was on MI (10.0% routine invasive strategy versus 12.9% selective invasive strategy), and there were consistent trends for fewer cardiovascular deaths (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.01; p=0.068) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.77 to 1.05). There were absolute reductions of 2.0% to 3.8% in cardiovascular death or MI in the low- and intermediate-risk groups and an 11.1% absolute risk reduction in the highest-risk patients. The invasive strategy demonstrated its greatest advantage in the highest-risk stratum of patients with no significant benefit on mortality over the noninvasive approach in moderate- and low-risk patients (342). An ischemia-guided strategy has been used with favorable results in initially stabilized patients with NSTE-ACS at elevated risk for clinical events, including those with positive troponin levels (338). One limitation of these studies is the absence of adherence to optimal medical therapy in noninvasively treated patients during long-term management. In addition, in FRISC-II, invasive management was delayed and patients with markedly positive stress tests (up to 2.9-mm exercise-induced ST depression) were randomized to noninvasive or invasive therapy (338).\n\nTable 8Factors Associated With Appropriate Selection of Early Invasive Strategy or Ischemia-Guided Strategy in Patients With NSTE-ACS\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 18for additional information on comparison of early invasive strategy and ischemia-guided strategy.\n\nIn some studies, early angiography and coronary intervention have been more effective in reducing ischemic complications than delayed interventions, particularly in patients at high risk (defined by a GRACE score \u003e140) (139,336). A more delayed strategy is also reasonable in low- to intermediate-risk patients. The advantage of early intervention was achieved in the context of intensive background antithrombotic and anti-ischemic therapy. However, this question was also assessed by a meta-analysis of 11 trials (7 RCTs and 4 observational studies) (343). Meta-analysis of the RCTs was inconclusive for a survival benefit of the early invasive strategy (OR: 0.83 [95% CI: 0.64 to 1.09]; p=0.180), and there were no significant differences in MI or major bleeding; a similar result was found with the observational studies. These data are limited by the small sample size of the individual trials, low event rates, inconsistency in timing of intervention, and heterogeneous patient profiles.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 19for additional information on comparison of early versus delayed angiography.\n\nThe TACTICS-TIMI (Treat Angina With Tirofiban and Determine Cost of Therapy With an Invasive or Conservative Strategy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) 18 trial demonstrated a reduction in the 6-month endpoint of death or MI in older adults with ACS (138). Controversy exists over revascularization treatment differences between men and women with ACS. The FRISC-II trial showed a benefit of revascularization in men for death or MI that was not observed for women (344). In contrast, death, MI, or rehospitalization rates were reduced for both men and women in TACTICS-TIMI 18 (138). RITA-3 showed that the routine strategy of invasive evaluation resulted in a beneficial effect in high-risk men that was not seen in women (342). A meta-analysis suggests that in NSTE-ACS, an invasive strategy has a comparable benefit in men and high-risk women for reducing the composite endpoint of death, MI, or rehospitalization (141,345,346). In contrast, an ischemia-guided strategy is preferred in low-risk women (141). Another collaborative meta-analysis of randomized trials reported that an early invasive strategy yielded similar RR reductions in overall cardiovascular events in patients with and without diabetes mellitus (347). However, an invasive strategy appeared to reduce recurrent nonfatal MI to a greater extent in patients with diabetes mellitus.\n\nCoronary angiography is designed to provide detailed information about the size and distribution of coronary vessels, the location and extent of atherosclerotic obstruction, and the suitability for revascularization. The LV angiogram, usually performed with coronary angiography, provides an assessment of the extent of focal and global LV dysfunction and of the presence and severity of coexisting disorders (e.g., valvular or other associated lesions). Patients with NSTE-ACS can be divided into risk groups on the basis of their initial clinical presentation. The TIMI, PURSUIT, and GRACE scores are useful tools for assigning risk to patients with NSTE-ACS.\n\nRisk stratification identifies patients who are most likely to benefit from subsequent revascularization. Patients with left main disease or multivessel CAD with reduced LV function are at high risk for adverse outcomes and are likely to benefit from CABG. Clinical evaluation and noninvasive testing aid in the identification of most patients at high risk because they often have ≥1 of the following high-risk features: advanced age (\u003e70 years of age), prior MI, revascularization, ST deviation, HF, depressed resting LV function (i.e., LVEF ≤0.40) on noninvasive study, or noninvasive stress test findings, including magnetic resonance imaging (348). Any of these risk factors or diabetes mellitus may aid in the identification of high-risk patients who could benefit from an invasive strategy.\n\nSome patients with NSTE-ACS are not in the very high-risk group and do not have findings that portend a high risk for adverse outcomes. They are not likely to receive the same degree of benefit from routine revascularization afforded to high-risk patients, and an invasive study is optional for those at lower risk and can be safely deferred pending further clinical evidence. Decisions about coronary angiography in patients who are not at high risk according to findings on clinical examination and noninvasive testing can be individualized on the basis of patient preferences and/or symptoms.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Noninvasive stress testing is recommended in low- and intermediate-risk patients who have been free of ischemia at rest or with low-level activity for a minimum of 12 to 24 hours (349–353). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.Treadmill exercise testing is useful in patients able to exercise in whom the ECG is free of resting ST changes that may interfere with interpretation (349–352). (Level of Evidence: C)\n    3.Stress testing with an imaging modality should be used in patients who are able to exercise but have ST changes on resting ECG that may interfere with interpretation. In patients undergoing a low-level exercise test, an imaging modality can add prognostic information (349–352). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    4.Pharmacological stress testing with imaging is recommended when physical limitations preclude adequate exercise stress. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    5.A noninvasive imaging test is recommended to evaluate LV function in patients with definite ACS (349–352). (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nThe management of patients with NSTE-ACS requires continuous risk stratification. Important prognostic information is derived from initial assessment, the patient’s course during the early days of management, and the response to anti-ischemic and antithrombotic therapy. The choice of stress test is based on the patient’s resting ECG and ability to exercise, local expertise, and available technologies. The exercise intensity of the treadmill test (low level or symptom-limited) is used at the discretion of the attending clinician based on individual patient assessment. For invasively managed patients with residual nonculprit lesions, additional evaluation may be indicated to ascertain the significance of such lesions. Refer to the PCI CPG for additional details (26).\n\nThe goals of noninvasive testing in patients with a low or intermediate likelihood of CAD and high-risk patients who did not have an early invasive strategy are to detect ischemia and estimate prognosis. This information guides further diagnostic steps and therapeutic measures.\n\nBecause of its simplicity, lower cost, and widespread familiarity with its performance and interpretation, the standard low-level exercise electrocardiographic stress test remains the most reasonable test in patients who are able to exercise and who have a resting ECG that is interpretable for ST shifts. There is evidence that imaging studies are superior to exercise electrocardiographic evaluation in women for diagnosis of CAD (350). However, for prognostic assessment in women, treadmill exercise testing has provided comparable results to stress imaging (354). Patients with an electrocardiographic pattern that would interfere with interpretation of the ST segment (baseline ST abnormalities, bundle-branch block, LV hypertrophy with ST-T changes, intraventricular conduction defect, paced rhythm, pre-excitation, and digoxin) should have an exercise test with imaging. Patients who are unable to exercise should have a pharmacological stress test with imaging. Low- and intermediate-risk patients with NSTE-ACS may undergo symptom-limited stress testing, provided they have been asymptomatic and clinically stable at 12 to 24 hours for those with UA and 2 to 5 days for patients at similar risk with NSTEMI (349). The optimal testing strategy in women is less well defined than in men.\n\nIn contrast to noninvasive tests, coronary angiography provides detailed structural information for assessment of prognosis and appropriate management. When combined with LV angiography, it also provides an assessment of global and regional LV function. Coronary angiography is usually indicated in patients with NSTE-ACS who have recurrent symptoms or ischemia despite adequate medical therapy or who are at high risk as categorized by clinical findings (HF, serious ventricular arrhythmias), noninvasive test findings (significant LV dysfunction with EF \u003c0.40, large anterior or multiple perfusion defects or wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, high-risk Duke treadmill score ≤−11), high-risk TIMI or GRACE scores, or markedly elevated troponin levels. Patients with NSTE-ACS who have had previous PCI or CABG should also be considered for early coronary angiography, unless prior coronary angiography data indicate that no further revascularization is feasible.\n\nThe general indications for coronary angiography and revascularization should be tempered by individual patient characteristics and preferences (a patient-centered approach). Patient and clinician judgments about risks and benefits are important for patients who might not be candidates for coronary revascularization, such as very frail older adults and those with serious comorbid conditions (e.g., severe hepatic, pulmonary, or renal failure; active or inoperable cancer).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 20for additional information on risk stratification.\nMyocardial Revascularization\n\nRecommendations about coronary artery revascularization indications, benefits, and choice of revascularization procedure (PCI or CABG) for all anatomic subsets have been published in the 2011 PCI CPG (26), the 2011 CABG CPG (23), and the 2012 stable ischemic heart disease CPG and its 2014 focused update (10,11). The main difference between management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease and NSTE-ACS is a stronger impetus for revascularization in those with NSTE-ACS. Myocardial ischemia in ACS may progress to MI and is potentially life threatening. In addition, in patients with ACS, angina (including recurrent angina) is more likely to be reduced by revascularization than by medical therapy (26).\n\nA “heart team” approach to revascularization decisions, involving an interventional cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon, is used in patients with unprotected left main or complex CAD. Calculation of SYNTAX (Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery) and STS scores is reasonable in these patients to guide the choice of revascularization (23,26,355).\n\nFactors that influence the choice of revascularization procedure include the extent and complexity of CAD; short-term risk and long-term durability of PCI; operative mortality (which can be estimated by the STS score); diabetes mellitus; CKD; completeness of revascularization; LV systolic dysfunction; previous CABG; and the ability of the patient to tolerate and comply with DAPT. In general, the greater the extent and complexity of the multivessel disease, the more compelling the choice of CABG over multivessel PCI (23,26,356–358). In patients with NSTE-ACS, PCI of a culprit unprotected left main coronary artery lesion is an option if the patient is not a candidate for CABG (23,26).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplements 21 and 22for additional information on myocardial revascularization.\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.A strategy of multivessel PCI, in contrast to culprit lesion−only PCI, may be reasonable in patients undergoing coronary revascularization as part of treatment for NSTE-ACS (330,359–364). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nApproximately half of all PCI procedures are performed in patients with UA or NSTEMI, and approximately 32% to 40% of patients with NSTE-ACS will undergo PCI (365). As discussed previously, in patients with NSTE-ACS, a strategy of early angiography and revascularization (primarily with PCI) results in lower rates of recurrent UA, recurrent rehospitalization, MI, and death (366,367). Although PCI of a nonculprit lesion is not advocated in patients with STEMI (26), there is less agreement on whether nonculprit lesions should undergo intervention at the time of culprit-lesion PCI for NSTE-ACS. Most reports (359–364), but not all (330), comparing culprit lesion−only PCI with multivessel PCI (e.g., PCI of multiple vessels performed at the same time) in patients with NSTE-ACS did not find an increased risk of MACE with multivessel PCI and found a reduction in the need for repeat revascularization. However, the data consist predominantly of post hoc analysis of nonrandomized data with variable duration of follow-up. This question has not been resolved and is an area of current investigation.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Patients already taking daily aspirin before PCI should take 81 mg to 325 mg non–enteric-coated aspirin before PCI (26,368–370).

(Level of Evidence: A)\n    6.In patients receiving a stent (bare-metal stent or drug-eluting stent [DES]) during PCI for NSTE-ACS, P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be given for at least 12 months (330).

(Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class III: Harm\n    1.Prasugrel should not be administered to patients with a prior history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (302). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nComprehensive recommendations on the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI are given in the 2011 PCI CPG (26). Aspirin reduces the frequency of ischemic complications after PCI and is ideally administered at least 2 hours, and preferably 24 hours, before PCI (26,368,369). DAPT, consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor, in patients treated with coronary stents reduces the risk of stent thrombosis and composite ischemic events (296,331,372–375,389,390). Compared with a loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel, a loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel in patients undergoing PCI achieves greater platelet inhibition with fewer low responders and decreases the incidence of MACE (376–378). In patients with ACS who have undergone coronary stenting, treatment with prasugrel or ticagrelor, compared with treatment with clopidogrel, results in a greater reduction in composite ischemic events and the incidence of stent thrombosis, although at a risk of increased non–CABG bleeding (293,302). The optimal duration of DAPT therapy in patients treated with DES is not well established (26). However, aspirin is continued indefinitely in all patients managed with a bare-metal stent or DES, and DAPT is an option for \u003e12 months in patients who have received a DES. This determination should balance the risks of stent thrombosis and ischemic complications versus bleeding and should be jointly made by the clinician and the patient.\n\nLoading and short-term maintenance doses of clopidogrel were studied in CURRENT–OASIS (Clopidogrel Optimal Loading Dose Usage to Reduce Recurrent Events–Organization to Assess Strategies in Ischemic Syndromes) 7, which demonstrated a potential benefit of higher-dose clopidogrel (600-mg loading dose, 150 mg daily for 6 days, 75 mg daily thereafter) in patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing an invasive management strategy (292,391). Although the overall trial (292) failed to demonstrate a significant difference in the primary endpoint between the clopidogrel and aspirin groups (4.2% versus 4.4%), the PCI subset (n=17,263) showed significant differences in the clopidogrel arm (391). Notably, the higher-dose clopidogrel therapy increased major bleeding in the entire group (2.5% versus 2.0%; p=0.012) and the PCI subgroup (1.1% versus 0.7%; p=0.008). In addition, during the period of several hours required for conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite, there is reduced effectiveness. However, efficacy is restored following conversion.\n\nPatients undergoing PCI who have previously received a loading dose of 300 mg of clopidogrel and are on a 75-mg daily maintenance dose should receive another 300-mg loading dose (315). There are no data appropriate for prasugrel because this drug is administered before PCI. For ticagrelor, there are no data on additional loading.\n\n    Class I\n    1.In patients with NSTE-ACS and high-risk features (e.g., elevated troponin) who are not adequately pretreated with clopidogrel or ticagrelor, it is useful to administer a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab, double-bolus eptifibatide, or high-dose bolus tirofiban) at the time of PCI (379–382). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.In patients with NSTE-ACS and high-risk features (e.g., elevated troponin) treated with UFH and adequately pretreated with clopidogrel, it is reasonable to administer a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (abciximab, double-bolus eptifibatide, or high-dose bolus tirofiban) at the time of PCI (195,383). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nGP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist therapy in patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI reduced the incidence of composite ischemic events, primarily through a decrease in documented MI, although in some trials this is counterbalanced by an increased rate of bleeding (193,195,310,379–382,392). Most, but not all, randomized trials of the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor were conducted in the era before clopidogrel therapy (193,195,310,379–383,392). Abciximab, double-bolus eptifibatide, and high-bolus dose tirofiban result in a high degree of platelet inhibition, reduce ischemic complications in patients undergoing PCI, and appear to afford comparable angiographic and clinical outcomes (26). As trials of the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors generally excluded patients at high risk of bleeding, recommendations for the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are best understood as applying to patients not at high risk of bleeding complications. Although GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors were used in 27% and 55% of patients, respectively, in the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) and TRITON studies of ticagrelor and prasugrel, there are insufficient data (293,302,393) (and no RCT data) from which to make specific recommendations about GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor use in patients treated with either of these P2Y12 inhibitors.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 21for additional information on GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.\n\n    Class I\n    1.An anticoagulant should be administered to patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI to reduce the risk of intracoronary and catheter thrombus formation.

(Level of Evidence: B)\n\nAnticoagulant therapy prevents thrombus formation at the site of arterial injury, on the coronary guide wire, and in the catheters used for PCI (26,407). With rare exceptions, all PCI studies have used some form of anticoagulant at the time of PCI (26). Intravenous UFH and bivalirudin both have Class I recommendations in patients undergoing PCI in the 2011 PCI CPG (26). Patients who have received multiple doses of subcutaneously-administered enoxaparin who undergo PCI within 8 hours of the last subcutaneous dose generally have received adequate anticoagulation to undergo PCI, but the degree of anticoagulation may diminish 8 to 12 hours after the last subcutaneous dose. In such patients, as well as in patients who have received fewer than 2 subcutaneous doses of enoxaparin, the addition of enoxaparin (0.3 mg/kg IV) at the time of PCI provides additional anticoagulation and has become standard practice (26,309,399–403). Patients who undergo PCI \u003e12 hours after the last subcutaneous dose of enoxaparin are usually treated with full-dose de novo anticoagulation with an established regimen (e.g., full-dose UFH or bivalirudin). Fondaparinux as the sole anticoagulant during PCI has been associated with catheter thrombosis, and use of an anticoagulant with anti-IIa activity is recommended when patients treated with fondaparinux undergo PCI (313–315). One suggested regimen is UFH 85 IU/kg IV if no GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor is used and 60 IU/kg IV if a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor is used with UFH dosing based on the target-activated clotting time (314,404) (Table 9) (26,313–315).\n\nTable 9Dosing of Parenteral Anticoagulants During PCI\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\n    Class I\n    1.Non–enteric-coated aspirin (81 mg to 325 mg daily) should be administered preoperatively to patients undergoing CABG (408–410).

(Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.In patients referred for urgent CABG, it may be reasonable to perform surgery less than 5 days after clopidogrel or ticagrelor has been discontinued and less than 7 days after prasugrel has been discontinued. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nIn-hospital CABG is performed in 7% to 13% of patients hospitalized with NSTE-ACS (420–422). Approximately one third of patients with NSTEMI undergo CABG within 48 hours of hospital admission (421). In these patients, CABG was performed at a median time of 73 hours after admission (interquartile range: 42 to 122 hours) (421). In-hospital mortality in patients with NSTEMI undergoing CABG is approximately 3.7% (421).\n\nRecommendations for management of patients treated with oral and intravenous antiplatelet agents who undergo CABG are given in the 2011 CABG CPG (23). Preoperative aspirin reduces operative morbidity and mortality, and CABG can be performed safely in patients on aspirin therapy with only a modest increase in bleeding risk (23,408–410). The use of P2Y12 inhibitors in patients with NSTE-ACS is associated with an increase in post–CABG bleeding and the need for transfusion (293,302,411,413,423–425). Although it is recommended that clopidogrel and ticagrelor be discontinued at least 5 days before surgery and prasugrel at least 7 days before surgery in patients referred for elective CABG (23,411–413), the timing of CABG in patients with NSTE-ACS treated with a P2Y12 inhibitor (330) should reflect a balance of the potential increase in bleeding against the potential benefits of not delaying surgery 5 to 7 days. The risk of major bleeding complications is increased when CABG is performed \u003c24 hours after discontinuation of clopidogrel (23,416,417). In patients who undergo CABG 1 to 4 days after discontinuation of clopidogrel, it appears that the incidence of life-threatening bleeding is not significantly increased, but an increase in blood transfusions is likely (23,415,416,425,426). In the TRITON-TIMI 38 trial (302), the incidence of CABG-related major bleeding was higher in patients treated with prasugrel than in patients treated with clopidogrel (23,386). In the PLATO trial, the rates of major bleeding and transfusion requirements were similar between patients treated with ticagrelor and patients treated with clopidogrel (294). The more rapid recovery of platelet function in pharmacokinetic studies of ticagrelor did not translate to a lower risk of bleeding or lessen the need for transfusion compared with clopidogrel when CABG was performed early (i.e., \u003c5 days) after drug discontinuation (23,293,412).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplements 21 and 22for more information on myocardial revascularization.\nLate Hospital Care, Hospital Discharge, and Posthospital Discharge Care\n\nThe goals of therapy after NSTE-ACS are to restore the patient to normal activities to the extent possible and to use the acute event to re-evaluate the plan of care, particularly lifestyle and risk factor modification. Aggressive risk factor modifications that can prolong survival should be the main goal of long-term management of patients with stable CAD. Patients presenting with NSTE-ACS represent a high-risk cohort in whom secondary cardiovascular disease prevention is likely to be particularly effective (Table 10). Clinicians have an opportunity to provide evidence-based care to this high-risk cohort and to aggressively treat the underlying atherosclerotic process through lifestyle modification and effective pharmacological therapies (427). In most cases, the inpatient anti-ischemic medical regimen should be continued after discharge, and the antiplatelet/anticoagulant medications should be changed to an outpatient regimen. The goals for continued medical therapy after discharge relate to potential prognostic benefits (primarily shown for antiplatelet agents, beta blockers, statins, and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, especially for LVEF \u003c0.40). Added benefits are control of ischemic symptoms (nitrates, beta blockers, CCBs, and ranolazine) and treatment of major risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, physical inactivity, obesity, and diabetes mellitus (427). Selection of a medical regimen should be individualized to each patient on the basis of in-hospital findings, risk factors for CAD, drug tolerability, and recent procedural interventions. The mnemonic “ABCDE” (Aspirin, Antianginals, and ACE Inhibitors; Beta Blockers and BP; Cholesterol and Cigarettes; Diet and Diabetes Mellitus; Education and Exercise) is useful in guiding treatment (428).\n\nTable 10Plan of Care for Patients With NSTE-ACS\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\n    Class I\n    1.Medications required in the hospital to control ischemia should be continued after hospital discharge in patients with NSTE-ACS who do not undergo coronary revascularization, patients with incomplete or unsuccessful revascularization, and patients with recurrent symptoms after revascularization.

(Level of Evidence: C)\n\nThe combination of oral antiplatelet therapy and oral anticoagulant therapy significantly increases the risk of bleeding. This risk varies widely, but on average, the addition of a single antiplatelet agent increased the risk of bleeding from a range of 2% to 3% to a range of 4% to 6%, whereas the addition of DAPT to oral anticoagulant therapy (“triple therapy”) increased the risk of bleeding from a range of 4% to 6% to a range of 10% to 14% (432–435). This risk was also related to the duration of triple therapy.\n\nIn patients with NSTE-ACS in whom there are indications for triple therapy, the benefit of such therapy in terms of prevention of stent thrombosis, thromboembolic events, and recurrent MI must be weighed against the risk of bleeding complications. Similarly, DAPT, in addition to anticoagulant therapy, requires consideration of the increased risk of bleeding. It is essential that therapeutic decision making in this critical area include discussion with the patient about the options, advantages, and limitations of available approaches.\n\nRecommendations about the management of patients treated with triple therapy have been published in ACC/AHA CPGs and by other organizations (17,26,430,433,436). Although some organizations have recommended a target INR of 2.0 to 2.5 in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who require triple therapy (437), others continue to recommend a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 (12,436). The HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal Renal/Liver Function, Stroke, Bleeding History or Predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drugs/Alcohol Concomitantly) score has relevance in these deliberations (439). No prospective study to date has demonstrated that a target INR of 2.0 to 2.5 reduces bleeding complications.\n\nWhenever possible, shorter durations of triple therapy are favored in preference to longer durations of triple therapy. In patients with NSTE-ACS who require oral anticoagulation for AF, mechanical heart valve, deep venous thrombosis, or other conditions, a bare-metal stent may offer the advantages of lower bleeding risk over a DES because of the potentially shorter duration of triple antithrombotic therapy. The WOEST (What is the Optimal Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary Stenting) trial is the first published study to address the question of optimal antiplatelet therapy in patients taking oral anticoagulant medication (440). WOEST was a randomized, open-label trial of 563 patients (approximately 25% of whom had NSTE-ACS) receiving oral anticoagulant therapy and undergoing coronary stenting. Patients randomized to single antiplatelet treatment with clopidogrel had significantly fewer bleeding complications and no increase in thrombotic events compared with those randomized to DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel. Larger clinical trials are needed to compare double versus triple therapy in the setting of coronary stenting and NSTE-ACS. One such study that has been initiated is PIONEER AF-PCI (an Open-Label, Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter Study Exploring two Treatment Strategies of Rivaroxaban and a Dose-Adjusted Oral Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment Strategy in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation who Undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention).\n\nAlthough there are some data on therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin, there is sparse information on the use of newer P2Y12 inhibitors (prasugrel, ticagrelor), direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran), or factor-Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban) in patients receiving triple therapy. Prasugrel (302) and ticagrelor (412) produce a greater degree of platelet inhibition than clopidogrel and are associated with greater rates of bleeding (300,302,412,441). These are important potential disadvantages in patients requiring triple therapy, a group in which the inherent risks of bleeding are significantly increased. (Overall bleeding risk was not increased with ticagrelor, although there was increased bleeding in certain subgroups on this drug (412)). Because there are no well-established therapies to reverse the anticoagulant effects of the newer oral antiplatelet agents, caution is required when considering the use of these agents in patients who require triple therapy and are at significantly increased risk of bleeding. This admonition is especially important in elderly patients, a group in which bleeding risk is inherently increased (Section 7.1).\n\nProton pump inhibitors decrease the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with DAPT (431) and are used in patients treated with DAPT who have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and those at increased risk of bleeding, which is associated with oral anticoagulation therapy even if there is no history of gastrointestinal bleeding (430). On the basis of these results, proton pump inhibitors are also used in patients receiving triple antithrombotic therapy who have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Although the clinical evidence that omeprazole and esomeprazole diminish the antiplatelet efficacy of clopidogrel is weak (430), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning to avoid concomitant use of these 2 proton pump inhibitors with clopidogrel (442).\n\nAlthough higher platelet reactivity has been associated with a greater incidence of adverse events in patients undergoing stent implantation, a strategy of adjusting antiplatelet therapy based on routine platelet function testing has not been beneficial in reducing ischemic complications (26,443–445). Similarly, a strategy of routine genetic phenotype testing has also not been beneficial and thus is not recommended (26,446–448). A more detailed discussion of these issues and current recommendations about platelet function testing and genetic testing are in the 2011 PCI CPG (26).\n\nSecondary prevention is a critical aspect of the management of care for the survivor of NSTE-ACS. It has been clearly established that in this high-risk cohort, subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and mortality can be reduced by a comprehensive approach to favorably modifying patients’ risk profiles (27).\n\nSecondary prevention comprises lifestyle changes, risk factor education, medical therapy, and, where appropriate, revascularization. These elements are discussed in Section 6.4. Despite the proven utility of secondary prevention, its implementation remains suboptimal, and enhanced application is a major goal in this patient population.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 23for additional information on risk reduction strategies.\n\n    Class I\n    1.All eligible patients with NSTE-ACS should be referred to a comprehensive cardiovascular rehabilitation program either before hospital discharge or during the first outpatient visit (449–452). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service emphasizes comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programs (449), and the 2011 secondary prevention CPG underscores referral to cardiac rehabilitation for survivors of ACS (27). Since 2007, referral to these programs has been designated a quality performance measure (453–455). Barriers to referral can be obviated by discussion with the patient and referral by the patient’s primary care clinician and/or cardiovascular caregiver. These comprehensive programs provide patient education, enhance regular exercise, monitor risk factors, and address lifestyle modification (456). Aerobic exercise training can generally begin 1 to 2 weeks after discharge in patients treated with PCI or CABG (457). Mild-to-moderate resistance training can be considered and started 2 to 4 weeks after aerobic training (458). Unsupervised exercise may target a heart rate range of 60% to 75% of maximum age-predicted heart rate based on the patient’s exercise stress test. Supervised training may target a higher heart rate (70% to 85% of age-predicted maximum) (457). Additional restrictions apply when residual ischemia is present. Daily walking can be encouraged soon after discharge for most patients. Resource publications on exercise prescription in cardiovascular patients are available (456,457). Regular physical activity reduces symptoms in patients with cardiovascular disease, enhances functional capacity, improves other risk factors such as insulin resistance and glucose control, and is important in weight control (456). Questionnaires and nomograms for cardiac patients have been developed to guide exercise prescription if an exercise test is unavailable (459–462).

(Level of Evidence: B)\n\nSelective COX-2 inhibitors and other nonselective NSAIDs have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk, and the risk appears to be amplified in patients with established cardiovascular disease (17,234,235,467,469). In a large Danish observational study of patients with first MI (n=58,432), the HR and 95% CI for death were 2.80 (2.41 to 3.25) for rofecoxib, 2.57 (2.15 to 3.08) for celecoxib, 1.50 (1.36 to 1.67) for ibuprofen, 2.40 (2.09 to 2.80) for diclofenac, and 1.29 (1.16 to 1.43) for other NSAIDs (234). There were dose-related increases in risk of death and non–dose-dependent trends for rehospitalization for MI for all drugs (234,467). An AHA scientific statement on the use of NSAIDs concluded that the risk of cardiovascular events is proportional to COX-2 selectivity and the underlying risk in the patient (237). Nonpharmacological approaches were recommended as the first line of treatment, followed by the stepped-care approach to pharmacological therapy, as shown in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4\n\nFigure 4\n\nStepped-Care Approach to Pharmacological Therapy for Musculoskeletal Symptoms in Patients With Known Cardiovascular Disease or Risk Factors for Ischemic Heart Disease\n\nASA indicates aspirin; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; GI, gastrointestinal; NSAIDs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and PPI, proton-pump inhibitor.\n\nImage not available.\nView Large  | Download Slide (.ppt) | View in Article Context\n\n    Class III: Harm\n    1.Hormone therapy with estrogen plus progestin, or estrogen alone, should not be given as new drugs for secondary prevention of coronary events to postmenopausal women after NSTE-ACS and should not be continued in previous users unless the benefits outweigh the estimated risks (17,470–472). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\nAlthough prior observational data suggested a protective effect of hormone therapy for coronary events, a randomized trial of hormone therapy for secondary prevention of death and MI (the HERS [Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement] study) failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect (473). There was an excess risk for death and MI early after initiation of hormone therapy. The Women’s Health Initiative included randomized primary prevention trials of estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone (472). Both trials were stopped early owing to an increased risk related to hormone therapy that was believed to outweigh the potential benefits of further study (470–472). It is recommended that postmenopausal women receiving hormone therapy at the time of a cardiovascular event discontinue its use and that hormone therapy should not be initiated for the primary or secondary prevention of coronary events. However, there may be other permissible indications for hormone therapy in postmenopausal women (e.g., treatment of perimenopausal symptoms such as flushing or prevention of osteoporosis) if the benefits are believed to outweigh the increased cardiovascular risk. Postmenopausal women who are \u003e1 to 2 years past the initiation of hormone therapy who wish to continue such therapy for another compelling indication should weigh the risks and benefits, recognizing the greater risk of cardiovascular events and breast cancer (combination therapy) or stroke (estrogen) (473).\n\n    Class III: No Benefit\n    1.Antioxidant vitamin supplements (e.g., vitamins E, C, or beta carotene) should not be used for secondary prevention in patients with NSTE-ACS (474,475). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    2.Folic acid, with or without vitamins B6 and B12, should not be used for secondary prevention in patients with NSTE-ACS (476,477). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\nAlthough there is an association of elevated homocysteine blood levels and CAD, a reduction in homocysteine levels with routine folate supplementation did not reduce the risk of CAD events in 2 trials (the NORVIT [Norwegian Vitamin Trial] and the HOPE [Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation] study) that included post–MI or high-risk stable patients (476–478) and produced poorer outcomes in another study (479). Additionally, in the NORVIT trial, there was a trend toward increased cardiovascular events (95% CI: 1.00 to 1.50; p=0.05) in the cohort receiving the combination of folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12; the authors cautioned against using the treatment for secondary prevention (476). Similarly, experience in large clinical trials with antioxidant vitamins has failed to demonstrate benefit for primary or secondary prevention (474,475,480).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 23for additional information on antioxidant vitamins and folic acid.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Posthospital systems of care designed to prevent hospital readmissions should be used to facilitate the transition to effective, coordinated outpatient care for all patients with NSTE-ACS (481–485). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.An evidence-based plan of care (e.g., GDMT) that promotes medication adherence, timely follow-up with the healthcare team, appropriate dietary and physical activities, and compliance with interventions for secondary prevention should be provided to patients with NSTE-ACS. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    3.In addition to detailed instructions for daily exercise, patients should be given specific instruction on activities (e.g., lifting, climbing stairs, yard work, and household activities) that are permissible and those to avoid. Specific mention should be made of resumption of driving, return to work, and sexual activity (452,486,487). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    4.An annual influenza vaccination is recommended for patients with cardiovascular disease (27,488). (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nEducation of patients with NSTEMI and their families is critical and often challenging, especially during transitions of care. Failure to understand and comply with a plan of care may account for the high rate of AMI rehospitalization rates in the United States (489,490). An important intervention to promote coordination is to provide patients and caregivers with a comprehensive plan of care and educational materials during the hospital stay that support compliance with evidence-based therapies (491–493). The posthospitalization plan of care for patients with NSTE-ACS (Table 10) should address in detail several complex issues, including medication adherence and titration, timely follow-up, dietary interventions, physical and sexual activities, cardiac rehabilitation, compliance with interventions for secondary prevention, and reassessment of arrhythmic and HF risks. In addition, clinicians should pay close attention to psychosocial and socioeconomic issues, including access to care, risk of depression, social isolation, and healthcare disparities (494–496).\n\nThere has been improved understanding of the system changes necessary to achieve safer care (497). This includes adoption by all U.S. hospitals of a standardized set of “Safe Practices” endorsed by the National Quality Forum (498), which overlap with the National Patient Safety Goals espoused by The Joint Commission (499). Examples of patient safety standards for all patients after AMI include improved communication among clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists; medication reconciliation; careful transitions between care settings; and consistent documentation. The National Quality Forum has also endorsed a set of patient-centered “Preferred Practices for Care Coordination” (500), which detail comprehensive specifications that are necessary to achieve successful care coordination for patients and their families. Systems of care designed to support patients with NSTE-ACS, STEMI, and other cardiac diseases can result in significant improvement in patient outcomes. Table 10 provides reference documents for multiple risk-reduction strategies for secondary prevention in the posthospital phase of NSTE-ACS. These include the 2013 ACC/AHA CPGs on management of blood cholesterol (18), obesity (16), and lifestyle (15) and the 2014 recommendations for management of hypertension (501), which were published during the development of this CPG. To provide the interventions and services listed in Table 10, appropriate resources must be used so that patients with MI have full access to evidence-based therapies and follow-up care. There is a growing emphasis on penalizing hospitals for avoidable hospital readmissions. It is imperative for health systems to work with clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, communities, payers, and public agencies to support the interventions that achieve comprehensive care. Several patient characteristics have been predictors of readmission after AMI (502,503).\nSpecial Patient Groups\n\nSee Table 11 for summary of recommendations for this section.\n\nTable 11Summary of Recommendations for Special Patient Groups\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\n    Class I\n    1.Older patients∗∗\n\n    ∗∗ ∗∗Those ≥75 years of age (see text).\n    with NSTE-ACS should be treated with GDMT, an early invasive strategy, and revascularization as appropriate (515–519). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    2.Pharmacotherapy in older patients∗∗ with NSTE-ACS should be individualized and dose adjusted by weight and/or CrCl to reduce adverse events caused by age-related changes in pharmacokinetics/dynamics, volume of distribution, comorbidities, drug interactions, and increased drug sensitivity (515,520–522). (Level of Evidence: A)\n    3.Management decisions for older patients∗∗ with NSTE-ACS should be patient centered, and consider patient preferences/goals, comorbidities, functional and cognitive status, and life expectancy (515,523–525). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.Bivalirudin, rather than a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor plus UFH, is reasonable in older patients∗∗ with NSTE-ACS, both initially and at PCI, given similar efficacy but less bleeding risk (396,526–528). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.It is reasonable to choose CABG over PCI in older patients∗∗ with NSTE-ACS who are appropriate candidates, particularly those with diabetes mellitus or complex 3-vessel CAD (e.g., SYNTAX score \u003e22), with or without involvement of the proximal LAD artery, to reduce cardiovascular disease events and readmission and to improve survival (529–534). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nIn this CPG, “older adults” refers to patients ≥75 years of age (515). Older adults have the highest incidence, prevalence, and adverse outcomes of NSTE-ACS (9,515–517,535,536). Older age is accompanied by comorbidities, polypharmacy, and age- and disease-related physiological changes that adversely impact NSTE-ACS presentation, management, and outcome. As older patients are under-represented in clinical trials, the recommendations in this CPG are largely supported by registry data and meta-analyses (516,537).\n\nOlder patients with NSTE-ACS primarily present with chest pain but frequently have atypical symptoms. ECGs may be less diagnostic than in younger patients (517,538). Older patients with NSTE-ACS derive the same or greater benefit from pharmacological therapies, interventional therapies, and cardiac rehabilitation as younger patients, but older patients receive significantly less GDMT than younger patients, even when adjusted for comorbidities (515–517,535,538,539). In the ACSIS (Acute Coronary Syndrome Israeli Survey) registry, patients \u003e80 years of age referred for early coronary angiography, compared with no angiography, had lower 30-day and 1-year mortality rates (540).\n\nAge-related pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic changes can alter drug dosing, efficacy, and safety of many NSTE-ACS therapies, as can drug–drug interactions (Appendix 4, Table B) (515,520,521,541,542). CrCl or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should be estimated initially and throughout care for all older patients with NSTE-ACS, and pharmaceutical agents should be renally and weight dose-adjusted to limit drug toxicity (especially bleeding risk), given the unreliability of serum creatinine to assess age-related renal dysfunction (515,522,526,543–545) (Appendix 4, Table C). Bleeding in older patients with NSTE-ACS is multifactorial, resulting in narrower therapeutic windows (541,542,544,546,547).\n\nIn the CRUSADE (Can Rapid Risk Stratification of Unstable Angina Patients Suppress Adverse Outcomes With Early Implementation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines) study, excessive doses of UFH, LMWH, and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors accounted for 15% of major bleeding, longer lengths of stay, and increased mortality (522,548). Aspirin should be maintained at 81 mg per day (after initial stent implantation). Owing to excess bleeding without clinical benefit, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lists a Black Box warning that does not recommend administration of prasugrel to patients with NSTE-ACS who are ≥75 years of age or weigh \u003c60 kg except in those at very high risk. A meta-analysis of 6 RCTs about the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with NSTE-ACS reported no significant age-treatment interaction, although older women had significantly more adverse events (549). Bivalirudin appears safer for older patients with NSTE-ACS ± PCI than GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors plus UFH, with less bleeding and similar efficacy (526,550). AF is more common in older patients with NSTE-ACS, and triple therapy (DAPT and warfarin) entails a marked bleeding risk (551). In the WOEST (What is the Optimal Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant Therapy in Patients With Oral Anticoagulation and Coronary Stenting) study, it was found that in patients taking oral coagulants who required PCI, use of clopidogrel without aspirin was associated with a significant reduction in bleeding complications and no increase in thrombotic events (440). Nonetheless, practice should not be changed on the basis of this limited study alone.\n\nOlder patients with NSTE-ACS benefit as much or more than younger patients from an early invasive strategy compared with an ischemia-guided strategy (340,341,515,518,519). In a 5-year follow-up meta-analysis of FRISC-II and RITA-3, an early invasive strategy versus an ischemia-guided strategy was associated with a significant reduction in death/MI and MI in patients ≥75 years of age but not in patients \u003c65 years of age (518). Although the highest risk reduction in death/MI with an early invasive strategy occurred in those ≥75 years of age, this strategy was associated with a 3-fold bleeding risk (552). However, despite the overall favorable evidence for an early invasive strategy in older patients, age is the strongest risk factor for this group not undergoing an early invasive strategy (553).\n\nPCI has increased in older patients, including the very elderly (≥90 years of age), with success rates similar to younger patients and declining complication rates, including major bleeding (515,517,526–528,554). Several large registries report a greater RR reduction in mortality of older patients treated with revascularization versus medical therapy compared with those ≤65 years of age, despite increased comorbidities (517,540,554–556).\n\nOperative mortality rates for CABG in patients ≥80 years of age with NSTE-ACS range from 5% to 8% (11% for urgent cases) and increase to approximately 13% at ≥90 years of age. Complications occur more frequently in older patients with CABG (557,558). Length of stay averages 6 days longer in older patients than in patients \u003c50 years of age, and discharge (to home [52%]) is less frequent than in younger patients (557). In a meta-analysis, off-pump CABG appeared to offer a potentially safer and more effective revascularization technique compared with on-pump CABG in older patients with NSTE-ACS (559). Older patients with NSTE-ACS with diabetes mellitus had a greater survival advantage with CABG (529). Evaluation tools can help identify older patients with NSTE-ACS whose risk and comorbidity profile predict mortality within 6 to 12 months and possibly guide a palliative approach (524).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 24for additional information on older patients.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Patients with a history of HF and NSTE-ACS should be treated according to the same risk stratification guidelines and recommendations for patients without HF (14,42–44,75–81). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.Selection of a specific revascularization strategy should be based on the degree, severity, and extent of CAD; associated cardiac lesions; the extent of LV dysfunction; and the history of prior revascularization procedures (14,138,141,333,334,337,341,560,561). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nIn patients with HF and NSTE-ACS, the plan of care should be implemented as in patients without HF using medical therapy and an early invasive approach, because patients with abnormal LV function are at increased risk of mortality and morbidity (562). HF itself may be associated with elevated serum troponin in the presence or absence of obstructive CAD. After angiography, risk stratification can be used to select revascularization strategies. The effect of surgical revascularization on improving survival has been most clearly demonstrated in patients with both extensive CAD and LV dysfunction (356,357,563–567). Such patients should undergo testing to identify the severity and extent of ischemia and should in general be referred for coronary angiography. In selected patients with appropriate anatomy, PCI has been used (23,568). In patients who have already undergone CABG or in whom the anatomy is not favorable for CABG, PCI has been performed using CPG-based PCI performance strategies if specific targeted areas that are amenable to PCI can be identified (26). If there is a large amount of ischemic territory and very poor LV function, percutaneous ventricular assist devices or, in less severe cases, an IABP can be used for support during the procedure (266,569–573).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 25for additional information on HF.\n\nVentricular arrhythmias are common early after onset of NSTE-ACS, and not all require intervention. The mechanisms for these arrhythmias include continuing ischemia, hemodynamic and electrolyte abnormalities, reentry, and enhanced automaticity. Approximately 5% to 10% of hospitalized patients may develop ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF), usually within 48 hours of presentation (574). The incidence of VF in otherwise uncomplicated AMI appears to have decreased within the past few years from \u003e4% to \u003c2%, of which 59% of patients had non–Q-wave MI (574). A study of 277 consecutive patients with NSTE-ACS who underwent cardiac catheterization within 48 hours found VT/VF occurring in 7.6% of patients, 60% of which developed within 48 hours after admission (575). Risk factors for VT/VF include HF, hypotension, tachycardia, shock, and low TIMI flow grade. Treatment consists of immediate defibrillation or cardioversion for VF or pulseless sustained VT. Early administration of beta blockers has been associated with reduction in incidence of VF (576). The prophylactic use of lidocaine is not recommended. Although VT/VF is associated with higher 90-day mortality risk, premature ventricular contractions not associated with hemodynamic compromise and accelerated ventricular rhythms do not confer higher mortality risks and do not require specific therapy other than maintaining electrolyte balance. NSTE-ACS nonsustained VT occurring \u003e48 hours after admission indicates an increased risk of cardiac and sudden death, especially when associated with accompanying myocardial ischemia (577). Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias that occur \u003e48 hours after NSTE-ACS are usually associated with LV dysfunction and signify poor prognosis. RCTs in patients with ACS have shown consistent benefit of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy for survivors of VT or VF arrest (578–582). For other at-risk patients, especially those with significantly reduced LVEF, candidacy for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should be readdressed ≥40 days after discharge (583). A life vest may be considered in the interim.\n\nAF, atrial flutter, and other supraventricular arrhythmias may be triggered by excessive sympathetic stimulation, atrial stress due to volume overload, atrial infarction, pericarditis, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia, or pulmonary disease. AF is the most common of these arrhythmias and may develop in \u003e20% of patients. AF is associated with shock, HF, stroke, and increased 90-day mortality (584). Management of AF requires rate control and adequate anticoagulation according to the 2014 AF CPG (12). For hemodynamically unstable patients and those with continuing ischemia, treatment should be implemented according to the 2010 advanced cardiac life support CPGs (585).\n\nSinus bradycardia is especially common with inferior NSTEMI. Symptomatic or hemodynamically significant sinus bradycardia should be treated with atropine and, if not responsive, temporary pacing. The incidence of complete heart block is 1.0% to 3.7% in NSTEMI, based on anterior or posterior/inferior location, respectively (586). Atrioventricular block and bundle-branch block develop in approximately 5% of patients (587). High-degree atrioventricular block or bundle-branch block in anterior NSTEMI is more ominous because of a greater extent of myocardial injury and involvement of the conduction system (587).\n\nFirst-degree atrioventricular block does not require treatment. High-grade atrioventricular block after inferior NSTEMI usually is transient, with a narrow QRS complex and a junctional escape rhythm that can be managed with an ischemia-guided strategy. Prophylactic placement of a temporary pacemaker is recommended for high-grade atrioventricular block, new bundle-branch block, or bifascicular block with anterior infarction. Indications for permanent pacing are reviewed in the 2012 device-based therapy CPG (20).\n\n    Class I\n    1.Early revascularization is recommended in suitable patients with cardiogenic shock due to cardiac pump failure after NSTE-ACS (560,588,589). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nAMI is the leading cause of cardiogenic shock. Early revascularization is a mainstay in the treatment of cardiogenic shock (560,589). Compared with medical therapy, early revascularization is associated with improved 6-month mortality (560) and 13% absolute mortality reduction at 6 years (588). Urgent revascularization with CABG may be indicated for failed PCI, coronary anatomy not amenable to PCI, and at the time of surgical repair of a mechanical defect (e.g., septal, papillary muscle, free-wall rupture). Age alone is not a contraindication to urgent revascularization for cardiogenic shock (589,590). Mortality after cardiogenic shock has steadily improved (591), including in older adults (589,590), with 30-day mortality ranging from approximately 40% with milder forms of shock (268) to \u003e45% with refractory shock (592). Approximately 30% of patients in the IABP-SHOCK (Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump in Cardiogenic Shock) II trial presented with NSTEMI (268), and 22% of patients in the TRIUMPH (Tilarginine Acetate Injection in a Randomized International Study in Unstable Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients With Cardiogenic Shock) trial had ST depression on presentation (592). Of the 23% of patients with ACS who had NSTEMI in the GRACE registry, 4.6% of patients experienced cardiogenic shock (593). Of the 2,992 patients in shock, 57% underwent cardiac catheterization, and in-hospital revascularization was performed in 47% of this group.\n\nIn-hospital mortality of all patients with shock was 59% (594). Patients with NSTEMI developed cardiogenic shock later than patients with STEMI, and had higher-risk clinical characteristics, more extensive CAD, and more recurrent ischemia and infarction before developing shock compared with patients with STEMI, and shock developed later in patients with NSTEMI (151). Patients with NSTEMI constituted \u003e17% of those in the SHOCK trial registry (595). They were also older and had more comorbidities but had comparable mortality to patients with STEMI. The left circumflex coronary artery was the culprit vessel in 30% of patients with NSTEMI, suggesting the presence of true posterior MI (595). Dopamine in patients with cardiogenic shock may be associated with increased mortality compared with norepinephrine (596). The use of percutaneous ventricular assist devices has been hampered by the need for interventional expertise, cost, and lack of supportive evidence (597). IABP has been used for decades (265,598), and it may facilitate intervention in patients who are hemodynamically unstable, but it did not reduce mortality or secondary endpoints in 1 RCT of 598 patients with cardiogenic shock complicating AMI (268). Newer devices with higher levels of support have provided better hemodynamic support but without improved clinical outcomes compared with IABP (599,600).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 26for additional information on cardiogenic shock.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Medical treatment in the acute phase of NSTE-ACS and decisions to perform stress testing, angiography, and revascularization should be similar in patients with and without diabetes mellitus (138,339,601). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\nCAD accounts for 75% of deaths in patients with diabetes mellitus; \u003e30% of patients with NSTE-ACS have diabetes mellitus; and patients with NSTE-ACS and diabetes mellitus have more adverse outcomes (e.g., death, MI, readmission with ACS, or HF) during follow up (593,602,603). The latter may be related to increased plaque instability and comorbidities, including hypertension, LV hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, HF, and autonomic dysfunction (603–605). Patients with diabetes mellitus and ACS have longer delays from symptom onset to presentation (593,606,607), which may be attributable to their atypical symptoms.\n\nThere is a U-shaped relationship between glucose levels and mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus and ACS (543). Both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia have similar adverse effects on in-hospital and 6-month mortality. The urgency to aggressively control blood glucose has been moderated by the results of the NICE-SUGAR (Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation and Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regimen) trial (608). In this study of patients admitted to medical and surgical intensive care units, intensive glucose control (target 81 mg/dL to 108 mg/dL) resulted in increased all-cause mortality and hypoglycemia compared with moderate glucose control (target \u003c180 mg/dL). Blood glucose should be maintained at \u003c180 mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia. There is no established role for the administration of glucose-insulin-potassium infusions in NSTE-ACS (609–611).\n\nAlthough patients with diabetes mellitus and NSTE-ACS are at higher risk for in-hospital and longer-term events, they undergo less frequent revascularization procedures. In a multinational study of 6,385 patients with ACS, 25% of whom had diabetes mellitus, those with diabetes mellitus had more adverse risk profiles, more atypical presentations, longer treatment delays, more HF, and renal insufficiency but underwent less angiography and revascularization (607). In the GRACE Registry (593) and other studies (606), patients with diabetes mellitus and NSTE-ACS in the United Kingdom (603) and Finland (612) had higher baseline risk profiles but received effective medical cardiac therapies and revascularization less frequently.\n\nAlthough there are no RCTs of patients specifically diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and ACS, there are ample data on patients with diabetes mellitus treated with PCI or CABG (564,565,613–615). The largest RCT, the FREEDOM (Future Revascularization Evaluation in Patients With Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel Disease) trial (616), evaluated 1,900 patients (approximately 30% with “recent” [interval unspecified] ACS) with 2- or 3-vessel CAD randomized to a DES or CABG. At 5 years, there was a significant decrease in all-cause mortality (p=0.049; MI: p\u003c0.001) associated with CABG. There was no specific analysis of outcomes in patients with “recent” (interval unspecified) ACS. CABG was also superior to PCI in reducing MACE in other trials (564,613–615) (Appendix 4, Table D).\n\nThe importance of the severity and complexity of CAD was underscored in the SYNTAX trial, in which those with less severe and complex CAD had similar outcomes with PCI and CABG compared with those with more severe and complex disease, in which CABG improved outcomes, including survival (355,565).\n\nA meta-analysis (6 trials: 23,072 patients without diabetes mellitus, 6,458 patients with diabetes mellitus) of the effect of GP IIb/IIIa platelet receptor inhibitors (abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban) on mortality in NSTEMI revealed that for the entire patient group, a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor was associated with reduced 30-day mortality (6.2% to 4.6%; p=0.007) (392). This benefit was particularly large in the 1,279 patients with diabetes mellitus who underwent PCI (4.0% to 1.2%; p=0.002). The ACUITY trial in ACS (13,819 patients, 3,852 with diabetes mellitus) reported that 30-day adverse clinical outcomes (death, MI, or unplanned revascularization) or major bleeding were increased in patients with diabetes mellitus (12.9% versus 10.6%; p\u003c0.001) (617). Bivalirudin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor resulted in increased similar rates of the composite ischemia compared with heparin plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. Bivalirudin alone was associated with a similar increased rate of composite ischemia but less major bleeding (3.7% versus 7.1%; p\u003c0.001).\n\nSeveral studies evaluated the benefit of oral antiplatelet therapy during ACS in patients with diabetes mellitus. In TRITON-TIMI 38, patients with diabetes mellitus had a greater reduction in ischemic events without an observed increase in TIMI major bleeding with prasugrel compared with clopidogrel (618). In PLATO, ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel reduced ischemic events irrespective of diabetic status and glycemic control, without an increase in major bleeding (619).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 27for additional information on diabetes mellitus.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Patients with prior CABG and NSTE-ACS should receive antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy according to GDMT and should be strongly considered for early invasive strategy because of their increased risk (67,68,141,340–342). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nAlthough CABG reduces morbidity and mortality in selected patients with complex CAD, they remain at risk for development of disease progression of ungrafted native vessels or significant atherothrombotic disease in saphenous vein grafts and subsequent ACS. These patients constitute a higher-risk group because they have already undergone CABG, typically for more extensive CAD, and they have more comorbidities (620–624).\n\nIn the PURSUIT trial, 12% (1,134) of the patients had prior CABG and more adverse follow-up outcomes, including increased mortality, but had a benefit with eptifibatide similar to those without prior CABG (622). Patients with prior CABG are less likely to undergo early catheterization after NSTEMI. In the Get With The Guidelines study of patients with NSTEMI, 18.5% had prior CABG and a lower likelihood of early invasive evaluation but had higher rates of guideline-recommended clopidogrel and bivalirudin therapy and lower rates of GP IIb/IIIa and anticoagulant therapy (625). In patients with prior CABG who develop NSTE-ACS that is related to an ungrafted native coronary vessel, treatment should follow GDMT (26).\n\nBecause patients with prior CABG presenting with ACS are a high-risk group with increased comorbid characteristics and high-risk anatomy, a strategy of early angiography should be implemented (unless clinically contraindicated), and these patients should receive optimal antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 28for additional information on post-CABG.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Patients who develop NSTE-ACS following noncardiac surgery should receive GDMT as recommended for patients in the general population but with the modifications imposed by the specific noncardiac surgical procedure and the severity of the NSTE-ACS (626,627). (Level of Evidence: C)\n    2.In patients who develop NSTE-ACS after noncardiac surgery, management should be directed at the underlying cause (21,626–634). (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nPatients with NSTE-ACS following noncardiac surgery should be managed according to the guidelines for patients in the general population, with risk stratification and guideline-based pharmacological and invasive management directed at the etiology (e.g., hypertension, tachycardia, HF, hypotension, sepsis, and anemia) with modifications based on the severity of NSTE-ACS and the limitations imposed by the noncardiac surgical procedure.\n\nThe definition of ACS has a substantial effect on reported incidence (178,184,635–644). Some patients may not be able to give a history of ischemic symptoms because of the noncardiac surgery. The criteria in the 2012 Third Universal Definition of MI should be applied (21). In patients at risk of ACS following noncardiac surgery, routine monitoring of troponins and ECGs may be performed. As the sensitivity of troponin assays improves, the frequency of identifying perioperative MI will increase. In the POISE (Perioperative Ischemic Study Evaluation) trial (645), of 8,351 patients randomized to extended-release metoprolol versus placebo, 5.7% of patients in the control group had a perioperative MI typically occurring within 48 hours and often not associated with ischemic symptoms.\n\nACS in the setting of noncardiac surgery is associated with increased mortality. Several risk scores have been developed to determine the probability of mortality (646–648). A meta-analysis of the prognostic value of troponin and CK-MB after noncardiac surgery that included 14 studies enrolling 3,318 patients demonstrated that elevated troponin after surgery was an independent predictor of mortality both in the hospital and at 1-year follow-up (639). Markedly elevated troponins are associated with increased mortality compared with minimal troponin elevation, even though the latter still indicates a postoperative MI (184,639,641,642). In patients with UA in whom the risks of bleeding with antiplatelet therapy outweigh the benefits, GDMT with beta blockers, nitrates, and ACE inhibitors should be optimized to achieve symptom control. In patients with a relative or absolute contraindication to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy, coronary angiography may be helpful to identify anatomy requiring revascularization after recovery from the noncardiac surgery.\n\n    Class I\n    1.CrCl should be estimated in patients with NSTE-ACS, and doses of renally cleared medications should be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetic data for specific medications (649,650). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.Patients undergoing coronary and LV angiography should receive adequate hydration. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.An invasive strategy is reasonable in patients with mild (stage 2) and moderate (stage 3) CKD (649–652). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nCKD is a major risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with NSTEMI (652–657). Patients with impaired renal function have additional adverse baseline characteristics, including older age, a history of prior HF, and peripheral arterial disease. It is prudent to omit LV angiography in patients with CKD and assess LV function with echocardiography.\n\nIn an analysis from 3 ACS trial databases of 19,304 patients with NSTEMI, 42% (8,152 patients) had abnormal renal function on the basis of serum creatinine and calculated CrCl; total mortality and mortality/MI were increased at 30 days and 180 days. CrCl was independently associated with mortality (HR: 0.81) and the risk of mortality/MI (HR: 0.93) (656). The VALIANT (Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial included 14,527 high-risk patients with AMI with LV dysfunction or HF and a serum creatinine level ≥1.5 mg/dL (658,659). The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation was used, and patients were analyzed based on their estimated GFR. There was an increasing adjusted HR for both death and the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, reinfarction, HF, stroke, or resuscitation after cardiac arrest with decreasing estimated GFR. For death, with a GFR \u003c45.0 mL per minute/1.73 m2, the adjusted HR was 1.70 compared with patients with a GFR of 60.0 mL per minute/1.73 m2 to 74.9 mL per minute/1.73 m2 in whom the adjusted HR was 1.14. There are insufficient data on the benefit-to-risk ratio of an invasive strategy in patients with NSTE-ACS and advanced CKD (stages 4 and 5) (652). There is also less evidence-based medical therapy and revascularization data in patients with CKD because of the risk for contrast-induced nephropathy, increased need for dialysis, and increased mortality. Multiple studies have evaluated radiographic agents, including ionic versus nonionic media and isosmolar or low-osmolar agents.\n\nThe strength and consistency of relationships between specific isosmolar or low-osmolar agents and contrast-induced nephropathy or renal failure are insufficient for selection of low-osmolar and isosmolar media. Limitation of the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy is based on reduced contrast volume (660) and adequate hydration (661).\n\nA recent meta-analysis of 5 RCTs evaluated 1,453 patients with NSTE-ACS and CKD, all with GFR \u003c60 mL per minute/1.73 m2(651). Patients were analyzed according to baseline renal function: stage 3a, 3b, and 4 to 5. An invasive strategy was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in all-cause mortality and the composite of death or nonfatal MI. An early invasive strategy in patients with CKD and ACS reduced rehospitalization and resulted in a trend toward lower mortality and nonfatal reinfarction. The increased risk of mortality associated with mild, moderate, and severe CKD is evident across studies, and risks are increased as the gradient of renal dysfunction worsens (649–651,662).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 29for additional information on CKD.\n\nPatients with CKD with ACS are at increased risk for ischemic complications, including stent thrombosis and post–PCI ischemic events (663). They are also predisposed to higher bleeding complications, which, in addition to the lack of clinical trial data, result in their undertreatment with antiplatelet therapy. Patients with advanced CKD exhibit high residual platelet reactivity despite treatment with clopidogrel independent of the presence of diabetes mellitus (664). Hyporesponsiveness to thienopyridines is associated with increased adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including cardiovascular mortality (665), and higher dosing regimens of clopidogrel do not appear to further suppress adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation (664,666).\n\nAlthough prasugrel may be more efficient than doubling the dose of clopidogrel in achieving adequate platelet inhibition (667), no clinical studies have demonstrated its efficacy in patients with CKD with ACS. Ticagrelor, however, was studied in a prespecified analysis from the PLATO trial (668). In patients with an estimated GFR \u003c60 mL per minute (nearly 21% of patients in PLATO with available central laboratory serum creatinine levels), ticagrelor significantly reduced the primary cardiovascular endpoint (17.3% versus 22.0%; HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.90) compared with clopidogrel (667). Notably, this was associated with a 4% absolute risk reduction in all-cause mortality favoring ticagrelor and with no differences in major bleeding, fatal bleeding, and non–CABG-related major bleeding events, demonstrating its utility in patients with renal insufficiency.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Women with NSTE-ACS should be managed with the same pharmacological therapy as that for men for acute care and for secondary prevention, with attention to weight and/or renally calculated doses of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents to reduce bleeding risk (669–673). (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.Women with NSTE-ACS and high-risk features (e.g., troponin positive) should undergo an early invasive strategy (141,345,346,561). (Level of Evidence: A)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.Myocardial revascularization is reasonable in pregnant women with NSTE-ACS if an ischemia-guided strategy is ineffective for management of life-threatening complications (674). (Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class III: No Benefit\n    1.Women with NSTE-ACS and low-risk features (see Section 3.3.1) should not undergo early invasive treatment because of the lack of benefit (141,345,346) and the possibility of harm (141). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nWomen of all ages have higher rates of in-hospital and long-term complications of NSTE-ACS than men, including bleeding, HF, cardiogenic shock, acute renal failure, recurrent MI, stroke, and readmissions (670,675,676).\n\nWomen present later after symptom onset of NSTE-ACS and have higher rates of inappropriate discharges from the ED (671,677,678). Women more commonly report atypical symptoms than men (675,679). Women presenting with chest pain are more likely than men to have either a noncardiac cause or cardiac causes other than obstructive epicardial coronary disease (108,677,680,681). Women with NSTE-ACS with no apparent obstructive epicardial disease have a 2% risk of death or MI within 30 days and require secondary prevention and symptom management (682).\n\nWomen derive the same treatment benefit as men from aspirin, clopidogrel, anticoagulants, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins (385,670–672,675,676,683,684). Despite worse outcomes, women with NSTE-ACS are underprescribed guideline-directed pharmacological therapy, both during the acute illness and at discharge (538,685,686). The basis for pharmacotherapy for women with NSTE-ACS with abnormal biomarkers and/or functional tests, but without significant obstructive epicardial disease, remains unclear (Section 7.13). In addition to risk factor modification, some studies support the benefit of imipramine, ranolazine, beta blockers, and/or ACE inhibitors to reduce adverse outcomes (687). Women with NSTE-ACS incur a higher rate of bleeding complications (672,673) (Section 7.8) and renal failure. A risk score has been developed to attempt to reduce the bleeding risk in women with NSTE-ACS (688).\n\nThe decision for an early invasive versus an ischemia-guided strategy in women with NSTE-ACS is based on a meta-analysis (366) and post hoc gender analyses of clinical trials, including FRISC II, RITA-3, and TACTICS-TIMI 18 (344,346,689). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality analysis of an early invasive versus ischemia-guided strategy (345) provides further evidence that an early invasive strategy should be reserved for women with positive troponins, as shown in TACTICS-TIMI 18 (346). Such women had a significant reduction of death and MI at 1 year with an early invasive versus ischemia-guided strategy. Women with NSTE-ACS and no elevation in troponin who underwent an early invasive strategy had a nonsignificant increase in events, as did women with a low-risk TIMI score (OR: 1.59 for early invasive versus ischemia-guided strategy), prompting the Class III recommendation in this CPG.\n\nThe NCDR-ACTION registry reported increased complication rates of myocardial revascularization in women (https://www.ncdr.com/webncdr/action/). Women also have higher rates of contrast-induced nephropathy and vascular complications (673,690,691). Despite having fewer high-risk angiographic lesions, a higher percentage of normal LV function, and up to 25% angiographically normal coronary arteries, women with NSTE-ACS have a paradoxically higher rate of persistent angina, reinfarction, functional decline, and depression after PCI (141,675,677,680,682). Clinical trials (692,693), and a meta-analysis (694) of DES for NSTE-ACS reported no gender differences in short- and long-term (up to 5 years) outcome, including target vessel revascularization, MACE, cardiac death, or MI. However, women were older and had more comorbidities than men at enrollment.\n\nWomen with NSTE-ACS referred for CABG are older with more comorbidities, which is reflected by higher periprocedural mortality, HF, bleeding, MI, and renal failure (686,695,696). Women required more periprocedural IABP, vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and blood products and had longer stays in the intensive care unit and hospital, higher rates of wound infection, depression, and longer recovery (549,677).\n\nAn Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality meta-analysis of 10 RCTs through December 2011 reported no efficacy or safety difference between PCI and CABG for NSTE-ACS in men or women in 30-day or 1-year MACE (death/MI/stroke). At 2 years, the procedural success remained equal in women but favored CABG in men (p=0.002) (345,564). The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reported similar outcomes in women with diabetes mellitus with PCI and CABG for NSTE-ACS at 7 years, but men with diabetes mellitus had fewer events with CABG. A prespecified gender analysis of the FREEDOM trial favored CABG over PCI for women with diabetes mellitus, although the difference was not as significant as it was for men (616).\n\nConsistent with the European Society of Cardiology recommendations, myocardial revascularization should be reserved for pregnant women with NSTE-ACS and very serious complications unresponsive to medical therapy (674).\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 30for more information on women.\n\n    Class I\n    1.All patients with NSTE-ACS should be evaluated for the risk of bleeding. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    2.Anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy should be weight-based where appropriate and should be adjusted when necessary for CKD to decrease the risk of bleeding in patients with NSTE-ACS (522,697,698). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\n    Class III: No Benefit\n    1.A strategy of routine blood transfusion in hemodynamically stable patients with NSTE-ACS and hemoglobin levels greater than 8 g/dL is not recommended (699–703). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nAnemia in patients with ACS is associated with an increased risk for Holter monitor−detected recurrent ischemia and for MACE, with greater anemia correlating with greater risk (704–708). In 1 large analysis of multiple studies, the risk of adverse outcome was higher in patients with NSTE-ACS with hemoglobin levels \u003c11 g/dL (704). The potentially detrimental effects of severe anemia include decreased myocardial oxygen delivery and increased MVO2 related to maintenance of a higher cardiac output (704,709,710). Patients with anemia are less likely to be treated with aspirin, and patients with ACS and anemia are likely to have more bleeding complications with PCI (711). This has been correlated with increased short-term risk of MACE outcomes, including mortality; long-term risk remains controversial (712–717). The ACUITY study suggests that the risk of mortality associated with bleeding is at least as great as that associated with procedure-related or spontaneous MI (718).\n\nMajor bleeding is a coprimary endpoint in many trials and is a consideration when assessing the “net clinical benefit” of a new drug. A “universal definition of bleeding” has been proposed to assist clinicians (547,719–721). The incidence of major bleeding in patients with ACS varies widely (0.4% to 10%) (715,722) owing to differing definitions of major bleeding, patient populations, anticoagulation regimens, and PCI or CABG. Factors in patients with ACS related to an increased bleeding risk include older age, female sex, lower body weight, history of prior bleeding and/or invasive procedures, anemia, use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors or thrombolytics, and CKD (522,711,713–715,722,723). Non–weight-based dosing of anticoagulants and dosing of antithrombin and antiplatelet medications that are not adjusted for CKD are associated with an increased risk of bleeding (522,697,698). Bleeding is related to adverse outcomes because it may be a marker of underlying disease, such as occult malignancy; leads to cessation of antithrombin and antiplatelet therapy; may prompt transfusion, which itself may have adverse effects; can cause hypotension; and, if intracranial, can be fatal (724). Proton pump inhibitors decrease the risk of upper GI bleeding, including in patients treated with DAPT. Proton pump inhibitors are used in patients with a history of prior GI bleeding who require DAPT and are an option in patients at increased risk of GI bleeding (26,430).\n\nEvaluation of the risk of bleeding includes a focused history of bleeding symptoms, identification of predisposing comorbidities, evaluation of laboratory data, and calculation of a bleeding risk score (688,716,725). Approximately 15% of all patients with NSTE-ACS and 3% to 12% of those not undergoing CABG receive blood transfusion (702). Rates vary widely and are closer to the lower figure but increase in association with factors such as coronary intervention, anticoagulant/antithrombotic therapy, older age, female sex, anemia, renal insufficiency, and frailty. Tissue oxygenation does not change or may actually decrease with transfusion (722). Blood transfusion in patients with ACS is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome, including death (702–704). A restrictive transfusion strategy leads to an outcome that is at least as good, if not better, than a liberal transfusion strategy (699,700). An analysis of a large ACS registry found no benefit from blood transfusion in patients with a nadir hematocrit \u003e24% (702). In a meta-analysis of 10 studies of patients with AMI, transfusion versus no transfusion was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (18.2% versus 10.2%; p\u003c0.001) and subsequent MI rate (RR: 2.0; 95% CI: 1.06 to 3.93; p=0.03) (726). A restrictive approach to transfusion generally consists of no routine transfusion for a hemoglobin level \u003e7 g/dL to 8 g/dL (699,700,727). A restrictive approach to blood transfusion is advocated by the American Association of Blood Banks (700) and the European Society of Cardiology (727). On the basis of data available at the time of publication, a strategy of routine liberal blood transfusion in hemodynamically stable patients with NSTE-ACS and mild to moderate anemia is not recommended.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 31for more information on anemia, bleeding, and transfusion.\n\nThe incidence of thrombocytopenia in patients with ACS varies from 1% to 13%. In 1 large prospective registry, one third of patients treated with prolonged heparin therapy developed some degree of thrombocytopenia (728). Independent risk factors for the development of thrombocytopenia include lower baseline platelet count, older age, ACS, cardiac or vascular surgery, intravenous UFH or both UFH and LMWH, duration of heparin therapy, and low body mass index (728–730). The risk of thrombocytopenia is increased in patients treated with abciximab and, to a lesser degree, with eptifibatide or tirofiban (731–734).\n\nThrombocytopenia on presentation or related to antithrombotic therapy is associated with significantly increased risk of thrombotic events, MI, major bleeding, and in-hospital mortality in patients with and without ACS (728–731,735–739). The OR for development of these endpoints with thrombocytopenia (compared to without thrombocytopenia) is 2 to 8. Data from the CATCH (Complications After Thrombocytopenia Caused by Heparin) registry identified a platelet count nadir of 125 × 109/L as a threshold, below which there is a linear augmentation in probability of bleeding (740). Results from CATCH highlighted that thrombocytopenia and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are often not diagnosed (728). Thrombocytopenia is generally a contraindication for GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy; direct thrombin inhibitors are often considered in preference to UFH or LMWH in patients with thrombocytopenia.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplements 31 and 32for additional information on anemia, bleeding, and transfusion.\n\n    Class I\n    1.Patients with NSTE-ACS and a recent history of cocaine or methamphetamine use should be treated in the same manner as patients without cocaine- or methamphetamine-related NSTE-ACS. The only exception is in patients with signs of acute intoxication (e.g., euphoria, tachycardia, and/or hypertension) and beta-blocker use, unless patients are receiving coronary vasodilator therapy. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.Benzodiazepines alone or in combination with nitroglycerin are reasonable for management of hypertension and tachycardia in patients with NSTE-ACS and signs of acute cocaine or methamphetamine intoxication (741–744). (Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class III: Harm\n    1.Beta blockers should not be administered to patients with ACS with a recent history of cocaine or methamphetamine use who demonstrate signs of acute intoxication due to the risk of potentiating coronary spasm. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nCocaine exerts multiple effects on the cardiovascular system, which may precipitate ACS (48,744,745). Acute cocaine exposure results in increased BP, heart rate, endothelial dysfunction, and platelet aggregation, all of which may precipitate ACS. Cocaine’s direct vasoconstrictor effect can produce coronary vasospasm. Long-term use of cocaine results in progressive myocyte damage and accelerated atherosclerosis (48,744,745).\n\nACS in patients with a history of cocaine use should be treated in the same manner as patients without cocaine use (744). The exception is in patients with ACS in the presence of acute cocaine intoxication. Because cocaine stimulates both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors, administration of intravenous beta blockers may result in unopposed alpha stimulation with worsening coronary spasm (48,132,744–746). Evidence suggests it is safe to administer intravenous beta blockers in patients with chest pain and recent cocaine ingestion, although information is lacking about the effects of beta-blocker administration during the acute stages of cocaine intoxication (747,748). Intravenous beta blockers should be avoided in patients with NSTE-ACS with signs of acute cocaine intoxication (euphoria, tachycardia, and/or hypertension). In these patients, benzodiazepines alone or in combination with nitroglycerin have been useful for management of hypertension and tachycardia owing to their effects on the central and peripheral manifestations of acute cocaine intoxication (741–744).\n\nMethamphetamine abuse is becoming increasingly common in the United States owing to the ease of manufacturing and the lower cost of methamphetamines compared with cocaine (131,749,750). Methamphetamines may be ingested orally, inhaled, or used intravenously. Methamphetamine affects the central nervous system by simultaneously stimulating the release and blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine (751). Like cocaine, methamphetamine exerts multiple effects on the cardiovascular system, all of which may precipitate ACS (131,750–752). The acute effects of methamphetamine are euphoria, tachycardia, hypertension, and arrhythmias. MI may result from coronary spasm or plaque rupture in the presence of enhanced platelet aggregation. Long-term use of methamphetamine has been associated with myocarditis, necrotizing vasculitis, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiomyopathy (750–752). Because methamphetamine and cocaine have similar pathophysiological effects, treatment of patients with ACS associated with methamphetamine and cocaine use should theoretically be similar.\n\nSeeOnline Data Supplement 33for additional information about cocaine and methamphetamine users.\n\n    Class I\n    1.CCBs alone (753–757) or in combination with long-acting nitrates (755,758) are useful to treat and reduce the frequency of vasospastic angina. (Level of Evidence: B)\n    2.Treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (759,760), cessation of tobacco use (761,762), and additional atherosclerosis risk factor modification (762,763) are useful in patients with vasospastic angina. (Level of Evidence: B)\n    3.Coronary angiography (invasive or noninvasive) is recommended in patients with episodic chest pain accompanied by transient ST-elevation to rule out severe obstructive CAD. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.Provocative testing during invasive coronary angiography††\n\n    †† ††Provocative testing during invasive coronary angiography (e.g., using ergonovine, acetylcholine, methylergonovine) is relatively safe, especially when performed in a controlled manner by experienced operators. However, sustained spasm, serious arrhythmias, and even death can also occur very infrequently. Therefore, provocative testing should be avoided in patients with significant left main disease, advanced 3-vessel disease, presence of high-grade obstructive lesions, significant valvular stenosis, significant LV systolic dysfunction, and advanced HF.\n    may be considered in patients with suspected vasospastic angina when clinical criteria and noninvasive testing fail to establish the diagnosis (764–767). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nVasospastic (Prinzmetal) angina chest pain typically occurs without provocation, is associated with ST-elevation, and usually resolves spontaneously or with rapid-acting nitroglycerin. Vasospastic angina may also be precipitated by emotional stress, hyperventilation, exercise, or the cold. It results from coronary vasomotor dysfunction leading to focal spasm (768), which may occasionally be multifocal within a single vessel and rarely involves \u003e1 vessel. Vasospastic angina occurs with normal coronary arteries, nonobstructive CAD, and obstructive CAD, but prognosis is least favorable with the latter. ST-elevation indicates transmural ischemia and corresponds to the distribution of the involved artery (769). A circadian variation is often present; most attacks occur in the early morning (770,771). The most prominent coronary risk factor is smoking. Most episodes resolve without complications, but arrhythmias, syncope, MI, and sudden death can occur (772).\n\nNonpharmacological provocative tests, such as cold pressor and hyperventilation, have been used diagnostically; potent vasoconstrictors (e.g., acetylcholine) may be useful when noninvasive assessment is uninformative (764–767). Smoking, which exacerbates coronary vasospasm, should be proscribed, and CCBs are first-line therapies (642); long-acting nitrates are also effective when combined with CCBs (755,758). Statins improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation and can be useful in vasospastic angina (759,760). Magnesium supplementation and alpha-receptor blockers may be effective and can be added (755,758).\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.If coronary angiography reveals normal coronary arteries and endothelial dysfunction is suspected, invasive physiological assessment such as coronary flow reserve measurement may be considered (629,773–776). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nACS associated with angiographically normal or nonobstructive (\u003c50% stenosis) coronary arteries (also referred to as syndrome X) may be related to coronary endothelial dysfunction (777); plaque rupture that may be evident only with intracoronary ultrasound (778); coronary vasospasm (779); and coronary artery dissection (780). Myocarditis may present with electrocardiographic and biomarker findings similar to ACS and can be distinguished by magnetic resonance imaging (781–783). Intracoronary ultrasound and/or optical coherence tomography to assess the extent of atherosclerosis and exclude obstructive lesions may be considered in patients with possible ACS and angiographically normal coronary arteries (778). If ECGs during chest pain are not available and coronary spasm cannot be ruled out, coronary angiography and provocative testing with acetylcholine, adenosine, or methacholine and 24-hour ambulatory ECG may be undertaken after a period of stabilization. Endothelial dysfunction is more common in women than in men (679,777,784–786), and chest pain is typical or atypical (785,786). In the absence of a culprit coronary lesion, prognosis of coronary endothelial dysfunction and/or occult plaque rupture is favorable (765,787).\n\nRisk factor reduction and medical therapy with nitrates, beta blockers, and CCBs alone or in combination are considered for endothelial dysfunction (788–790). High doses of arginine have also been given (791). Imipramine or aminophylline have been used in patients with endothelial dysfunction for continued pain despite optimal medical therapy. In postmenopausal women, estrogen reverses acetylcholine-induced coronary arterial vasoconstriction, presumably by improving endothelium-dependent coronary vasomotion, and reduces frequency of chest pain (792). However, estrogen is not recommended because of its demonstrated increase in cardiovascular and other risks (793).\n\nSpontaneous coronary artery dissection affects a young, predominantly female population. Treatment of spontaneous coronary artery dissection with CABG or stenting is described to improve outcome (794), but high rates of stenting complications are reported (780).\n\n    Class I\n    1.Stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy should be considered in patients who present with apparent ACS and nonobstructive CAD at angiography. (Level of Evidence: C)\n    2.Imaging with ventriculography, echocardiography, or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of stress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy (795–798).

(Level of Evidence: C)\n\n    Class IIb\n    1.Prophylactic anticoagulation may be considered to inhibit the development of LV thrombi. (Level of Evidence: C)\n\nStress (Takotsubo) cardiomyopathy (also referred to as transient LV apical ballooning or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) mimics NSTE or STEMI (799–803). There is no obstructive CAD, and the distribution of electrocardiographic changes and LV wall motion abnormalities usually includes \u003e1 coronary artery territory (801). Cardiac troponin elevations are usually modest (798). The majority of cases occur in postmenopausal women, and presentation is typically precipitated by emotional or physical stress. Imaging by echocardiography, ventriculography (696), or magnetic resonance imaging (699) demonstrates characteristic hypokinesis or dyskinesis of the LV apex with basilar increased contractility. Variants include hypokinesis of the mid or base of the left ventricle (795), and right ventricular involvement is common (804). In the vast majority of patients, electrocardiographic and LV wall motion abnormalities normalize within 1 to 4 weeks, and recurrences are uncommon (805). The pathogenesis has been attributed to excess catecholamine release (803), coronary spasm, or small coronary vessel hypoperfusion (806).\n\nCare is predominantly supportive and includes beta blockers, vasodilators, and catecholamines. The latter 2 interventions must be used cautiously, because they may induce outflow tract obstruction (800). If shock is present, IABP can be used. Prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered to prevent or treat LV thrombus (798).\n\nObesity is associated with conditions such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, arrhythmias, and HF that adversely affect ACS outcomes. In the MADIT (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation)-II trial, there was an inverse relation between body mass index and both all-cause mortality and sudden cardiac death in patients with LV dysfunction after MI (807). In the SYNERGY trial of 9,837 patients with NSTEMI, mortality was lower in morbidly obese patients, consistent with the “obesity paradox” (808). The “obesity paradox” has not been clarified and is under continuing investigation. Standard approaches to weight reduction in obese patients are usually unsuccessful in producing large decreases in weight. A weight reduction study of obese and morbidly obese patients following AMI resulted in weight loss of only 0.5% in obese patients and 3.5% in morbidly obese patients after 1 year (809). Two drugs, controlled-release phentermine/topiramate (810) and lorcaserin (811), are available for weight reduction but have not been studied in patients following NSTE-ACS. Bariatric surgery has been successful in reducing cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia but has not been evaluated in post–ACS patients (812). The 2013 obesity CPG provides comprehensive strategies for weight reduction (16).\n\nAntineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapy may contribute to the development of NSTE-ACS. For example, antineoplastic agents such as gemcitabine, sorafenib sunitinib, and 5-fluorouracil have been associated with coronary artery spasm or stenosis (813,814). Trastuzumab and possibly other anticancer drugs may alter biomarker levels (815). Antineoplastic agents can induce changes in the arterial wall (813), and modulators of inflammation may promote atherogenesis (816). In patients receiving these agents, it is prudent to communicate with the prescribing clinician about the necessity of their continuation during NSTE-ACS and future resumption.\nQuality of Care and Outcomes for ACS—Use of Performance Measures and Registries\n\n    Class IIa\n    1.Participation in a standardized quality-of-care data registry designed to track and measure outcomes, complications, and performance measures can be beneficial in improving the quality of NSTE-ACS care (817–825). (Level of Evidence: B)\n\nThe development of national systems for ACS is crucial and includes the participation of key stakeholders to evaluate care using standardized performance and quality-improvement measures for ACS (819,821). Standardized quality-of-care data registries include the NCDR Registry−Get With the Guidelines, the Get With the Guidelines quality-improvement program, the Acute Myocardial Infarction Core Measure Set, and performance measures required by The Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (817,823–825). The AHA has promoted its Mission: Lifeline initiative to encourage cooperation among prehospital emergency medical services personnel and cardiac care professionals (817). The evaluation of ACS care delivery across traditional boundaries can identify problems with systems and enable application of modern quality-improvement methods (818,820,822). On a local level, registries as part of the Chronic Care Model were associated with improved outcomes in chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (826,827).\n\nSummary and Evidence Gaps\n\nDespite landmark advances in the care of patients with NSTE-ACS since the publication of the 2007 UA/NSTEMI CPG (212), many emerging diagnostic and therapeutic strategies have posed new challenges. There is general acceptance of an early invasive strategy for patients with NSTE-ACS in whom significant coronary vascular obstruction has been precisely quantified. Low-risk patients with NSTE-ACS are documented to benefit substantially from GDMT, but this is often suboptimally used. Advances in noninvasive testing have the potential to identify patients with NSTE-ACS who are at intermediate risk and are candidates for invasive versus medical therapy.\n\nNewer, more potent antiplatelet agents in addition to anticoagulant therapy are indicated irrespective of initial treatment strategy. Evidence-based decisions will require comparative-effectiveness studies of available and novel agents. The paradox of newer and more potent antithrombotic and anticoagulant drugs that reduce major adverse cardiac outcomes but increase bleeding risk occurs with greater frequency in patients with AF. Patients with AF who develop NSTE-ACS and receive a coronary stent are the population at risk from triple anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy. This regimen has been reported to be safely modified by elimination of aspirin, a finding that requires confirmation.\n\nAmong the most rapidly evolving areas in NSTE-ACS diagnosis is the use of cardiac troponin, the preferred biomarker of myocardial necrosis. Although a truly high-sensitivity cardiac troponin is not available in the United States at the time this CPG was prepared, the sensitivity of contemporary assays continues to increase. This change is accompanied by higher rates of elevated cardiac troponin unrelated to coronary plaque rupture. The diagnostic quandary posed by these findings necessitates investigation to elucidate the optimal utility of this advanced biomarker. A promising approach to improve the diagnostic accuracy for detecting myocardial necrosis is measurement of absolute cardiac troponin change, which may be more accurate than the traditional analysis of relative alterations.\n\nSpecial populations are addressed in this CPG, the most numerous of which are older persons and women. More than half of the mortality in NSTE-ACS occurs in older patients, and this high-risk cohort will increase as our population ages. An unmet need is to more clearly distinguish which older patients are candidates for an ischemia-guided strategy compared with an early invasive management strategy. An appreciable number of patients with NSTE-ACS have angiographically normal or nonobstructive CAD, a group in which women predominate. Their prognosis is not benign, and the multiple mechanisms of ACS postulated for these patients remain largely speculative. Clinical advances are predicated on clarification of the pathophysiology of this challenging syndrome.\n\nA fundamental aspect of all CPGs is that these carefully developed, evidence-based documents cannot encompass all clinical circumstances, nor can they replace the judgment of individual physicians in management of each patient. The science of medicine is rooted in evidence, and the art of medicine is based on the application of this evidence to the individual patient. This CPG has adhered to these principles for optimal management of patients with NSTE-ACS.\nPresidents and Staff\n\nAmerican College of Cardiology\n\nPatrick O’Gara, MD, FACC, President\n\nShalom Jacobovitz, Chief Executive Officer\n\nWilliam J.

To keep pace with evolving\nevidence, the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Task Force on\nClinical Practice Guidelines (“Task Force”) has issued this focused update to revise existing guideline\nrecommendations on the basis of recently published study data. This update has been subject to rigorous,\nmultilevel review and approval, similar to the full guidelines. For specific focused update criteria and additional\nmethodological details, please see the ACC/AHA guideline methodology manual (1).\nModernization—Processes have evolved over time in response to published reports from the Institute of\nMedicine (2,3) and ACC/AHA mandates (4-7), leading to adoption of a “knowledge byte” format. This process\nentails delineation of a recommendation addressing a specific clinical question, followed by concise text (ideally\n\u003c500 words) and hyperlinked to supportive evidence. This approach better accommodates time constraints on\nbusy clinicians, facilitates easier access to recommendations via electronic search engines and other evolving\ntechnology, and supports the evolution of guidelines as “living documents” that can be dynamically updated as\nneeded.\nClass of Recommendation and Level of Evidence—The Class of Recommendation (COR) and Level of\nEvidence (LOE) are derived independently of each other according to established criteria. The COR indicates\nthe strength of recommendation, encompassing the estimated magnitude and certainty of benefit of a clinical\naction in proportion to risk. The LOE rates the quality of scientific evidence supporting the intervention on the\nbasis of the type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other sources (Table 1).\nRecommendations in this focused update reflect the new 2015 COR/LOE system, in which LOE B and C are\nsubcategorized for the purpose of increased granularity (1,7,8).\nRelationships With Industry and Other Entities—The ACC and AHA exclusively sponsor the work of\nguideline writing committees (GWCs) without commercial support, and members volunteer time for this\nactivity. Selected organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise are invited to\nparticipate as partners or collaborators. The Task Force makes every effort to avoid actual, potential, or\nperceived conflicts of interest that might arise through relationships with industry or other entities (RWI). All\nGWC members and reviewers are required to fully disclose current industry relationships or personal interests,\nbeginning 12 months before initiation of the writing effort. Management of RWI involves selecting a balanced\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n5\nGWC and requires that both the chair and a majority of GWC members have no relevant RWI (see Appendix 1\nfor the definition of relevance). GWC members are restricted with regard to writing or voting on sections to\nwhich RWI apply. Members of the GWC who recused themselves from voting are indicated and specific section\nrecusals are noted in Appendixes 1 and 2. In addition, for transparency, GWC members’ comprehensive\ndisclosure information is available as an Online Supplement (http://jaccjacc.acc.org/Clinical\n_Document/DAPT_Author_Relationships_With_Industry_and_Other_Entities_Comprehensive.pdf).\nComprehensive disclosure information for the Task Force is also available at http://www.acc.org/aboutacc/leadership/guidelines-and-documents-task-forces.aspx.\nThe Task Force strives to avoid bias by selecting\nexperts from a broad array of backgrounds representing different geographic regions, genders, ethnicities,\nintellectual perspectives, and scopes of clinical activities.\nIntended Use—Guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing\ncardiovascular disease. The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but guidelines developed in\ncollaboration with other organizations may have a broader target. Although guidelines may be used to inform\nregulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients’ interests. The\nguidelines are reviewed annually by the Task Force and are official policy of the ACC and AHA. Each guideline\nis considered current unless and until it is updated, revised, or superseded by a published addendum.\nRelated Issues—For additional information pertaining to the methodology for grading evidence, assessment of\nbenefit and harm, shared decision making between the patient and clinician, structure of evidence tables and\nsummaries, standardized terminology for articulating recommendations, organizational involvement, peer\nreview, and policies regarding periodic assessment and updating of guideline documents, we encourage readers\nto consult the ACC/AHA guideline methodology manual (1).\nJonathan L.

Introduction\nThe scope of this focused update is limited to addressing recommendations on duration of dual antiplatelet\ntherapy (DAPT) (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).\nRecommendations considered are those in 6 guidelines: “2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Percutaneous\nCoronary Intervention” (9), “2011 ACCF/AHA Guideline for Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery” (10),\n“2012 ACCF/AHA/ACP/AATS/PCNA/SCAI/STS Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of Patients\nWith Stable Ischemic Heart Disease” (11,12), “2013 ACC/AHA Guideline for the Management of STElevation\nMyocardial Infarction” (13), “2014 ACC/AHA Guideline for Non–ST-Elevation Acute Coronary\nSyndromes” (14), and “2014 ACC/AHA Guideline on Perioperative Cardiovascular Evaluation and\nManagement of Patients Undergoing Noncardiac Surgery” (15).\n The impetus for this focused update review is 11 studies (16-27) of patients treated with coronary stent\nimplantation (predominantly with drug-eluting stents [DES]) assessing shorter-duration or longer-duration\nDAPT, as well as a large, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients 1 to 3 years after myocardial infarction\n(MI) assessing the efficacy of DAPT compared with aspirin monotherapy (28). These studies were published\nafter the formulation of recommendations for duration of DAPT in prior guidelines. The specific mandate of the\npresent writing group is to evaluate, update, harmonize, and, when possible, simplify recommendations on\nduration of DAPT.\nAlthough there are several potential combinations of antiplatelet therapy, the term and acronym DAPT\nhas been used to specifically refer to combination antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor\n(clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor) and will be used similarly in this focused update. Recommendations in this\nfocused update on duration of DAPT, aspirin dosing in patients treated with DAPT, and timing of elective\nnoncardiac surgery in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and DAPT supersede prior\ncorresponding recommendations in the 6 relevant guidelines. These recommendations for duration of DAPT\napply to newer-generation stents and, in general, only to those not treated with oral anticoagulant therapy. For\nthe purposes of this focused update, patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) \u003e1 year prior\nwho have since remained free of recurrent ACS are considered to have transitioned to stable ischemic heart\ndisease (SIHD) and are addressed in the section on SIHD. Issues and recommendations with regard to P2Y12\ninhibitor “pretreatment,” “preloading,” and loading are beyond the scope of this document but are addressed in\nother guidelines (9,14,29).\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n8\nThis focused update is designed to function both as a standalone document and to serve as an update to the\nrelevant sections on duration of DAPT in the 6 clinical practice guidelines, replacing relevant text, figures, and\nrecommendations. Thus, by necessity, there is some redundancy in different sections of this document. When\npossible, the “knowledge byte” format was used for recommendations. In some cases, the complexity of this\ndocument required a modification of the knowledge byte format, with several interrelated recommendations\ngrouped together, followed by concise associated text (\u003c250 words of text per recommendation).\n1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review\nClinical trials published since the 2011 PCI guideline (9) and the 2011 coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)\nguideline (10), published in a peer-reviewed format through December 2015, were reviewed by the Task Force\nto identify trials and other key data that might affect guideline recommendations. The information considered\nimportant enough to prompt updated recommendations is included in evidence tables in the Online Data\nSupplement.\nIn accord with recommendations by the Institute of Medicine (2,3) and the ACC/AHA Task Force\nMethodology Summit (1,6), 3 critical (PICOTS-formatted); population, intervention, comparison, outcome,\ntiming, setting) questions were developed to address the critical questions related to duration of DAPT. These 3\ncritical questions were the basis of a formal systematic review and evaluation of the relevant study data by an\nEvidence Review Committee (ERC) (30). Concurrent with this process, writing group members evaluated study\ndata relevant to the numerous current recommendations in the 6 guidelines, including topics not covered in the 3\ncritical questions (e.g., DAPT after CABG). The findings of the ERC and the writing group members were\nformally presented and discussed, and then modifications to existing recommendations were considered.\nRecommendations that are based on a body of evidence that includes a systematic review conducted by the ERC\nare denoted by the superscript SR (e.g., LOE B-R SR).

Organization of the Writing Group\nRecommendations on duration of DAPT are currently included in 6 clinical practice guidelines, which are\ninterrelated and overlapping because they address the management of patients with CAD. Therefore, the writing\ngroup consisted of the chairs/vice chairs and/or members of all 6 guidelines, representing the fields of\ncardiovascular medicine, interventional cardiology, cardiac surgery, internal medicine, and cardiovascular\nanesthesia, as well as expertise in trial design and statistical analysis.\n1.3.

Critical Questions and Systematic Review Findings\n2.1. Critical Questions on Duration of DAPT\nThe 3 critical (PICOTS-formatted) questions on DAPT duration are listed in Table 2. Most contemporary\nstudies of DAPT have compared either shorter (3 to 6 months) (17-21) or longer (18 to 48 months) (16,22-26)\nduration of therapy with 12 months of DAPT, which is the recommended or minimal duration of therapy for\nmost patients in ACC/AHA (9,13,14) and European Society of Cardiology (31-33) guidelines published\nbetween 2011 and 2014. Recommendations based on the findings from the critical question–focused systemic\nreviews are provided in Sections 4 to 8 of the present document.\nTable 2. Critical (PICOTS-Formatted) Questions on DAPT Duration\nQ1: In patients treated with newer (non-first) generation DES for (1) SIHD or (2) ACS, compared with 12 months\nof DAPT, is 3–6 months of DAPT as effective in preventing stent thrombosis, preventing MACE and/or reducing\nbleeding complications?\nQ2: In patients treated with newer (non-first) generation DES, compared with 12 months of DAPT, does \u003e12 (18–\n48) months of DAPT result in differences in mortality rate, decreased MACE, decreased stent thrombosis, and/or\nincreased bleeding?\nQ3: In post-MI (NSTEMI or STEMI) patients who are clinically stable and \u003e12 months past their event, does\ncontinued DAPT, compared with aspirin monotherapy, result in differences in mortality rate, decreased nonfatal MI,\ndecreased MACE, and/or increased bleeding?\nACS indicates acute coronary syndrome; DAPT, dual antiplatelet therapy; DES, drug-eluting stents; MACE, major adverse\ncardiac events; MI, myocardial infarction; NSTEMI, non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction; PICOTS, population,\nintervention, comparison, outcome, timing, and setting; SIHD, stable ischemic heart disease; and STEMI, ST-elevation\nmyocardial infarction.\n2.2. Studies of Shorter-Duration DAPT After Stent Implantation\nFive RCTs of patients treated with elective DES implantation have compared shorter-duration (3 to 6 months)\nDAPT with 12 months of DAPT (17-21) (Data Supplement 1). The trials primarily enrolled low-risk (non-ACS)\npatients, with only a small proportion having had a recent MI. The main endpoints of these noninferiority trials\nwere composite ischemic events (or net composite events) and stent thrombosis. These studies, as well as\nseveral meta-analyses (34-37) and an analysis by the ERC (30), did not find any increased risk of stent\nthrombosis with shorter-duration DAPT. A shorter duration of DAPT results in fewer bleeding complications\n(30,34-36). Shorter-duration DAPT may be most reasonable in patients currently being treated with “newergeneration”\n(e.g., everolimus- or zotarolimus-eluting) DES, which are associated with lower stent thrombosis\nand MI rates than those of “first-generation” (e.g., sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting) DES, which are rarely, if\never, used in current clinical practice (16,36,38).\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n11\n2.3. Studies of Longer-Duration DAPT After Stent Implantation\nSix RCTs, consisting predominantly of patients treated with elective DES implantation, compared prolonged\nDAPT (total therapy duration: 18 to 48 months) with 6 to 12 months of DAPT to determine whether extended\ntherapy reduces late and very late stent thrombosis and prevents ischemic events associated with disease\nprogression and plaque rupture at other nonstented sites (16,22-27) (Data Supplement 2). In the Dual\nAntiplatelet Therapy study—the largest of these trials—patients who had undergone DES implantation, had\nbeen treated with DAPT for 12 months, and were without ischemic or bleeding events during this period were\nrandomized to an additional 18 months of DAPT or to aspirin monotherapy (16). Extended DAPT resulted in a\n0.7% absolute reduction in very late stent thrombosis, a 2.0% absolute reduction in MI, a 1.6% absolute\nreduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and a 0.9% absolute increase in moderate or severe\nbleeding. In the subgroup of patients treated with everolimus-eluting stents—currently the most commonly used\nstent—extended DAPT resulted in a 0.4% absolute reduction in stent thrombosis, a 1.1% absolute reduction in\nMI, and a 1.2% absolute increase in moderate/severe bleeding (39).\nTaken as a whole, studies of longer-duration (“prolonged” or “extended”) DAPT (16,22-27) for an\nadditional 18 to 36 months after DES found an absolute decrease in late stent thrombosis and ischemic\ncomplications of ≈1% to 2% and an absolute increase in bleeding complications of ≈1% (Data Supplements 2\nand 3). A weighted risk-benefit analysis by the ERC of studies of patients treated with DES found 6 fewer MIs\nand 3 fewer stent thromboses but 5 additional major bleeds per 1,000 patients treated with prolonged DAPT per\nyear (30).\n2.4. Other Studies Relevant to DAPT \u003e1 Year After MI\nThe CHARISMA (Clopidogrel for High Atherothrombotic Risk and Ischemic Stabilization, Management, and\nAvoidance) trial randomized patients with established atherosclerosis or at high risk of clinical atherosclerotic\ndisease to either DAPT (with clopidogrel) or aspirin monotherapy; with DAPT, no significant reduction was\nfound in ischemic effects at a median follow-up of 28 months, but there was a 0.4% absolute increase in severe\nbleeding (40). A post hoc analysis of patients enrolled in the study with prior MI found a 1.7% absolute decrease\nin the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke events with DAPT, with no benefit in those\nwith CAD without prior MI (40,41).\nPatients in the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Prior Heart\nAttack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin—Thrombolysis In Myocardial\nInfarction 54) trial were randomized 1 to 3 years after MI with additional high-risk features to either DAPT\n(with ticagrelor 60 mg or 90 mg twice daily) or continued aspirin monotherapy (28). After a mean of 33 months\nof therapy, DAPT, when compared with aspirin monotherapy, resulted in a 1.2% to 1.3% absolute reduction in\nthe primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke and a 1.2% to 1.5% absolute increase in\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n12\nmajor bleeding, with no excess in fatal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage. In subgroup analysis, the greatest\nreduction in ischemic events with prolonged DAPT was in patients in whom P2Y12 inhibitor therapy either had\nnot been discontinued or had been discontinued for ≤30 days (absolute reduction in MACE: 1.9% to 2.5%). No\nbenefit was seen in patients in whom P2Y12 inhibitor therapy had been discontinued \u003e1 year before enrollment\nin the study (42).\nIn the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy study, the benefit/risk ratio for prolonged DAPT was more favorable\nfor those presenting with MI than those with SIHD (43). In an analysis of patients with a history of prior MI\nenrolled in 6 RCTs of extended/prolonged DAPT, extended DAPT significantly decreased the absolute risk of\nMACE by 1.1% and significantly increased the absolute risk of major bleeding by 0.8% (44).\nTaken as a whole, trials of prolonged or extended DAPT suggest that the benefit/risk ratio of prolonged\nDAPT may be more favorable for those with prior MI, with an absolute decrease in ischemic events of ≈1% to\n3% at the cost of an absolute increase in bleeding events of ≈1% over the course of several years of prolonged or\nextended therapy (median durations of therapy: 18 to 33 months) (Data Supplements 3 and 4). This appears\nbiologically plausible because patients with prior MI (usually mediated by plaque rupture) may be at greater risk\nfor future plaque rupture than those without prior MI (37,40,41).\n2.5. Prolonged/Extended DAPT and Mortality Rate\nAn unexpected finding in the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy study (16) was a borderline-significant increase in\noverall mortality rate (0.5% absolute increase) with 30 months of DAPT versus 12 months of DAPT in DEStreated\npatients, which was due to significantly increased deaths from noncardiovascular causes (most\ncommonly cancer), with no increase in cardiovascular deaths, and no significant increase in fatal bleeding(45).\nFive subsequent meta-analyses (35-37,46,47) restricted to RCTs of studies enrolling patients treated with\npredominantly newer generation DES, published prior to the presentation of the OPTIDUAL (Optimal Dual\nAntiplatelet Therapy) trial, found numerically (36,47) or statistically (35,37,46) significant increased risk of allcause\n(though not cardiovascular) death associated with prolonged duration of DAPT (Data Supplements 3 and\n4).\nIn contrast, a meta-analysis that combined studies of DAPT duration after stent implantation with\nstudies of DAPT duration for other indications (48) and an analysis of 6 trials restricted to post-MI patients\ntreated with DAPT (44) found no increase in cardiovascular or noncardiovascular mortality rate associated with\nprolonged DAPT (Data Supplement 3). A U.S. Food and Drug Administration drug safety communication,\nbased on an evaluation of long-term clinical trials of patients with cardiovascular disease or stroke treated with\nclopidogrel, concluded that long-term clopidogrel treatment did not increase the risk of all-cause death or\ncancer-related death (49). The primary analysis by the ERC of 11 RCTs (including OPTIDUAL) compared use\nof DAPT for 18 to 48 months with use of DAPT for 6 to 12 months in patients who had received predominantly\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n13\nnewer-generation DES and found no statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality rate (30).\nA majority of writing group members believe the data as a whole do not seem to suggest prolonged\nDAPT results in increased mortality.\n3. Overriding Concepts and Recommendations for DAPT and Duration\nof Therapy\n3.1. General Overriding Concepts\nOverriding concepts and relevant recommendations for DAPT and duration of therapy are summarized in Table\n3. Intensification of antiplatelet therapy, with the addition of a P2Y12 inhibitor to aspirin monotherapy,\nnecessitates a fundamental tradeoff between decreasing ischemic risk and increasing bleeding risk (40,41,50-\n52). Similarly, longer compared with shorter duration of DAPT generally results in decreased ischemic risk at\nthe expense of increased bleeding risk (16,24,28,30,46). Use of more potent P2Y12 inhibitors (ticagrelor or\nprasugrel) in place of clopidogrel also results in decreased ischemic risk and increased bleeding risk (53-55).\nIn general, recommendations for duration of DAPT in the present focused update consist of a Class I\nrecommendation (“should be given”) for a minimum period of time (in most cases 6 to 12 months) and a Class\nIIb recommendation (“may be considered”) for continuation of DAPT beyond that period of time. Shorterduration\nDAPT can be considered for patients at lower ischemic risk with high bleeding risk, whereas longerduration\nDAPT may be reasonable for patients at higher ischemic risk with lower bleeding risk. These\nrecommendations do not generally apply to patients treated with oral anticoagulant therapy, who were excluded\nfrom almost all studies of DAPT duration and who are at significantly increased bleeding risk (as discussed in\nSection 3.4). Decisions about duration of DAPT are best made on an individual basis and should integrate\nclinical judgment, assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, and patient preference. Aspirin therapy is almost always\ncontinued indefinitely in patients with CAD, and recommendations on duration of DAPT should be taken to\nmean the recommended duration of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy (in addition to aspirin therapy). Figure 1\nsummarizes recommendations for duration of DAPT according to clinical status.\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n14\nTable 3.

Decisions about treatment with and duration of DAPT require a thoughtful\nassessment of the benefit/risk ratio, integration of study data, and consideration of patient preference.\n• In general, shorter-duration DAPT can be considered for patients at lower ischemic risk with high bleeding\nrisk, whereas longer-duration DAPT may be reasonable for patients at higher ischemic risk with lower\nbleeding risk.\n• Prior recommendations for duration of DAPT for patients treated with DES were based on data from “firstgeneration”\nDES, which are rarely if ever used in current clinical practice. Compared with first-generation\nstents, newer-generation stents have an improved safety profile and lower risk of stent thrombosis.\nRecommendations in this focused update apply to newer-generation stents.\n• Updated recommendations for duration of DAPT are now similar for patients with NSTE-ACS and STEMI,\nas both are part of the spectrum of acute coronary syndrome.\n• A Class I recommendation (“should be given”) in most clinical settings is made for at least 6-12 months of\nDAPT (depending on the setting), and a Class IIb recommendation (“may be reasonable”) is made for\nprolonged DAPT beyond this initial 6- to 12-month period.\n• In studies of prolonged DAPT after DES implantation or after MI, duration of therapy was limited to\nseveral years (akin to many other studied therapies). Thus, in patients for whom the benefit/risk ratio\nseemingly favors prolonged therapy, the true optimal duration of therapy is unknown.\n• Recommendations in the document apply specifically to duration of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy in patients with\nCAD treated with DAPT. Aspirin therapy should almost always be continued indefinitely in patients with\nCAD.\n• Lower daily doses of aspirin, including in patients treated with DAPT, are associated with lower bleeding\ncomplications and comparable ischemic protection (56-60) than are higher doses of aspirin. The\nrecommended daily dose of aspirin in patients treated with DAPT is 81 mg (range, 75 mg to 100 mg).\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n15\nFigure 1.

Patients\nwith a history of ACS \u003e1 year prior who have since remained free of recurrent ACS are considered to have transitioned to\nSIHD. In patients treated with DAPT after DES implantation who develop a high risk of bleeding (e.g., treatment with oral\nanticoagulant therapy), are at high risk of severe bleeding complication (e.g., major intracranial surgery), or develop\nsignificant overt bleeding, discontinuation of P2Y12 inhibitor therapy after 3 months for SIHD or after 6 months for ACS\nmay be reasonable.

Factors Associated With Increased Ischemic and Bleeding Risk\nFactors that have been associated with increased ischemic risk (including increased risk of stent thrombosis) and\nincreased bleeding risk are listed in Table 4. Individual patients may have factors for both increased ischemic\nand bleeding risk, and some factors are associated with both increased ischemic and bleeding risk, making it\ndifficult in many patients to assess the benefit/risk ratio of prolonged DAPT.\nA new risk score (the “DAPT score”), derived from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy study, may be useful\nfor decisions about whether to continue (prolong or extend) DAPT in patients treated with coronary stent\nimplantation. Analysis of study data suggest that in patients treated for 1 year with DAPT without significant\nbleeding or ischemic events, the benefit/risk ratio with prolonged DAPT may be favorable for those with a high\nDAPT score (≥2) because prolonged DAPT reduces net (ischemic plus bleeding) events when compared with\nnonprolonged DAPT (61). Conversely, in those with a low DAPT score (\u003c2), the benefit/risk ratio with\nprolonged DAPT is not favorable (increased bleeding without a reduction in ischemic events). Factors that\ncontribute to a high DAPT score include diabetes mellitus, current cigarette use, prior PCI or prior MI,\ncongestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction \u003c30%, MI at presentation, vein graft PCI, and stent\ndiameter \u003c3 mm; older age contributes to a low (less favorable) DAPT score. Factors and their weighting used\nto calculate a DAPT score are provided in Table 5.\nTable 4.

Specific P2Y12 Inhibitors: Recommendations\nSee Online Data Supplement 5 for evidence supporting these recommendations.\nRecommendations for Specific P2Y12 Inhibitors\nCOR LOE Recommendations\nIIa B-R\nIn patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with DAPT after\ncoronary stent implantation and in patients with NSTE-ACS treated with\nmedical therapy alone (without revascularization), it is reasonable to use\nticagrelor in preference to clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12 inhibitor\ntherapy (53,71,72).\nIIa B-R\nIn patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with DAPT after\ncoronary stent implantation who are not at high risk for bleeding\ncomplications and who do not have a history of stroke or TIA, it is\nreasonable to choose prasugrel over clopidogrel for maintenance P2Y12\ninhibitor therapy (54,55).\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n18\nIII:\nHarm B-R\nPrasugrel should not be administered to patients with a prior history of\nstroke or TIA (54).\nIn the PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) trial (53), patients with ACS were treated with either\nmedical therapy alone or medical therapy plus PCI. Treatment with ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily, compared with\nclopidogrel 75 mg once daily, resulted in fewer ischemic complications and stent thromboses but more frequent\nnon–CABG-related bleeding (Data Supplement 5). In the TRITON-TIMI 38 (Therapeutic Outcomes by\nOptimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel–Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 38) (54) study, patients\nwith ACS undergoing planned PCI were treated with prasugrel 10 mg daily, compared with clopidogrel 75 mg\ndaily. Prasugrel treatment resulted in fewer ischemic complications and stent thromboses but more frequent\nbleeding, including life-threatening and fatal bleeding. Because of increased rates of major bleeding with\nprasugrel (compared with clopidogrel), there was no net benefit of prasugrel therapy in those ≥75 years of age\nand those \u003c60 kg, and there was net harm (including increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage) in those with\nprior stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). The Class IIa preferential recommendations for ticagrelor 90 mg\ntwice daily and for prasugrel 10 mg once daily (compared with clopidogrel) in the 2014 Non–ST-Elevation\nAcute Coronary Syndromes (NSTE-ACS) guideline are continued in this focused update and are now included\nin relevant PCI and ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) recommendations, as well.\nIn the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 study of post-MI patients, both 60-mg and 90-mg twice-daily doses of\nticagrelor were evaluated (28). The benefit/risk ratio appears to be numerically more favorable for the 60-mg\ndose, although no formal statistical comparison was made between results of the 2 dosing regimens. The 60-mg\ntwice-daily dose has now been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for reduction in ischemic\nevents in patients with ACS or a history of MI (73).\n3.4. Platelet Function Testing, Genetic Testing, and Switching of P2Y12 Inhibitors\nThe role of platelet function testing and genetic testing in patients treated with DAPT is addressed in the 2011\nACCF/AHA/SCAI PCI guideline and the 2014 ACC/AHA NSTE-ACS guideline (9,14). To date, no RCT has\ndemonstrated that routine platelet function testing or genetic testing to guide P2Y12 inhibitor therapy improves\noutcome; thus, the routine use of platelet function and genetic testing is not recommended (Class III: No\nBenefit).\nNo randomized data are available on the long-term safety or efficacy of “switching” patients treated for\nweeks or months with a P2Y12 inhibitor to a different P2Y12 inhibitor.\n3.5. Proton Pump Inhibitors and DAPT\nThe use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients treated with DAPT is discussed in a 2010\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n19\nACCF/ACG/AHA expert consensus document (74). Recommendations on the use of PPIs are given in the 2011\nACCF/AHA/SCAI PCI guideline (9). PPIs should be used in patients with a history of prior gastrointestinal\nbleeding treated with DAPT (Class I). In patients with increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, including\nthose with advanced age and those with concomitant use of warfarin, steroids, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\ndrugs, use of PPIs is reasonable (Class IIa). Routine use of PPIs is not recommended for patients at low risk of\ngastrointestinal bleeding (Class III: No Benefit).\n3.6. Aspirin Dosing in Patients Treated With DAPT: Recommendation\nSee Online Data Supplement 6 for evidence supporting this recommendation.\nRecommendation for Aspirin Dosing in Patients Treated With DAPT\nCOR LOE Recommendation\nI B-NR In patients treated with DAPT, a daily aspirin dose of 81 mg (range, 75\nmg to 100 mg) is recommended (56-60,75-78).\nBecause aspirin dosing recommendations across ACC/AHA clinical practice guidelines are not consistent with\nregard to dose or class of recommendation, and because aspirin is a component of DAPT, a comprehensive\nreview of these issues was undertaken. Large overviews, including studies of nearly 200,000 persons, have\nconsistently shown that lower aspirin doses (≤100 mg daily) are associated with less major and total bleeding\nthan are higher doses, either when used as monotherapy or when combined with the P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel\n(56,58,75,76,78). Daily aspirin doses as low as 30 mg to 50 mg inactivate the platelet cyclo-oxygenase-1\nenzyme and inhibit thromboxane production (79-81). Studies comparing lower (75 mg to 150 mg) with higher\naspirin doses have consistently found comparable ischemic event rates with either dose when used as\nmonotherapy or when combined with the P2Y12 inhibitor clopidogrel (56-60,78). The efficacy of ticagrelor\nseems to be decreased in patients treated with higher aspirin doses (≥300 mg daily) versus lower aspirin doses\n(≤100 mg daily) (82). On the basis of available data, the optimal range of aspirin dose in patients treated with\nDAPT that provides maximal protection from ischemic events and minimizes bleeding risk appears to be 75 mg\nto 100 mg (Data Supplement 6). For practical purposes, because the relevant aspirin dose available in the United\nStates is 81 mg, this maintenance dose is recommended in patients with CAD treated with DAPT. The ongoing\nADAPTABLE (Aspirin Dosing: A Patient-Centric Trial Assessing Benefits and Long-term Effectiveness) trial,\nwhich the present writing group endorses, is expected to yield additional information on optimal aspirin dosing\nin patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (83).\n3.7. Triple Therapy (Aspirin, P2Y12 Inhibitor, and Oral Anticoagulant)\nThe recommended management of patients on “triple therapy” (aspirin, P2Y12 inhibitor, and oral anticoagulant)\nis beyond the scope of this focused update.

A partial summary and synthesis of these recommendations are given in Table 6.\n One trial comparing “double therapy” (oral anticoagulant plus clopidogrel) with triple therapy (oral\nanticoagulant plus aspirin and clopidogrel) (89) and 1 trial comparing differing durations of triple therapy have\nbeen published (90). Several more similar trials comparing oral anticoagulant therapy plus P2Y12 inhibitor with\ntriple therapy are ongoing.\nTable 6.

Duration of DAPT in Patients With SIHD and ACS Treated with PCI\nDAPT in patients treated with coronary stent implantation reduces the risk of stent thrombosis and ischemic\nevents (50,51,94,95,99) (Data Supplement 7). The risk of stent thrombosis in patients treated with a bare metal\nstent (BMS) is greatest in the first days to weeks after implantation (99,100). Cessation of DAPT during this\nperiod, particularly in cases of patients undergoing surgery, is associated with an unacceptable rate of often\ncatastrophic stent thrombosis (101-103). Thus, a minimum duration of DAPT of 1 month is generally\nrecommended for patients treated with BMS. In current practice, BMS are generally reserved for patients who\ncannot receive DAPT for more than ≈1 month for reasons of active bleeding, nonadherence to medical therapy,\nor planned surgery.\n The recommended minimum duration of DAPT in patients treated with first-generation DES, based\nprimarily on observational data and one subgroup analysis, has been 12 months (9,51,97,104,105). Compared\nwith first-generation DES, currently used newer-generation DES have a lower risk of stent thrombosis and\nappear to require a shorter minimum duration of DAPT (17,18,21,38,96,97). Five RCTs (17-21) of primarily\nlow-risk (non-ACS) patients treated with DES comparing shorter-duration (3 to 6 months) DAPT with 12\nmonths of DAPT, as well as several meta-analyses (34-37) and an analysis by the ERC (30), did not find an\nincreased risk of stent thrombosis with shorter-duration DAPT, although the individual trials were\nunderpowered to detect such a difference (Data Supplements 1 and 3). Therefore, in patients with SIHD treated\nwith DES, the minimum recommended duration of DAPT has been decreased from 12 to 6 months.\n The PCI-CURE analysis (51) of patients in the CURE (Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent\nRecurrent Events) trial (52) demonstrated that treatment with DAPT for up to 12 months in patients with NSTEACS\ntreated with BMS reduced ischemic events compared with aspirin monotherapy (Data Supplement 4).\nBased Primarily on the CURE trial and PCI-CURE analyses, the prior recommendation that patients with\nNSTE-ACS treated with coronary stent implantation be treated with DAPT for at least 12 months is continued in\nthis update and has been extrapolated to patients with STEMI treated with PCI as well, on the basis of the\nconsideration that NSTE-ACS and STEMI are part of the spectrum of ACS.\n As detailed in Section 2, treatment with prolonged (or “extended”) DAPT beyond a minimum\nrecommended duration of therapy necessitates a fundamental tradeoff between decreasing ischemic risk (e.g.,\nMI and stent thrombosis) and increasing bleeding risk (16,30,34,36,37,46). Prolonged or extended DAPT for an\nadditional 18 to 36 months (after an initial 6 to 12 months of DAPT) in patients treated with DES implantation\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n23\nresults in an absolute decrease in stent thrombosis and ischemic complications of ≈1% to 2% and an absolute\nincrease in bleeding complications of ≈1% (Data Supplements 1, 2, and 3) (16,22-27,30,35-37,46). Newergeneration\nstents, particularly everolimus-eluting stents, are associated with lower rates of stent thrombosis, and\nthe absolute reduction in the rate of stent thrombosis with prolonged DAPT in patients treated with everolimuseluting\nstents is modest (39,106-109).\nThe benefit/risk ratio of prolonged DAPT in patients treated with PCI may be more favorable for those\nwith prior MI (or ACS) than for those with SIHD (28,41,43). Preliminary data suggest that in patients with a\nhigh DAPT score the benefit/risk ratio with prolonged DAPT may be favorable and that in those with a low\nDAPT score the benefit/risk ratio with prolonged DAPT is not favorable (61). In patients treated with coronary\nstent implantation who have increased bleeding risk (e.g., oral anticoagulation), increased risk of severe\nbleeding complications (e.g., major intracranial surgery), or significant overt bleeding, the benefit/risk ratio may\nfavor shorter-than-recommended duration of DAPT (17-21,34,36). Decisions about treatment with and duration\nof DAPT require a thoughtful assessment of the benefit/risk ratio, integration of current and future study data,\nand consideration of patient preference.\nIn studies of drug-eluting bioabsorbable polymer stents and bioabsorbable stents (third- and fourthgeneration\nstents), by study protocol, DAPT was continued for at least 6 to 12 months (110-116). In a study of a\nnovel polymer-free and carrier-free drug-coated stent in patients at high risk of bleeding complications, by study\nprotocol, DAPT was continued for only 1 month (117). These stents have not been included in the studies of\nshorter- or longer-duration (prolonged/extended) DAPT discussed in this focused update. Because none of these\nstents (except one biodegradable polymer DES) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration at the\ntime this focused update was written, recommendations for duration of DAPT for such stents are not included.\n Recommendations for duration of DAPT in patients treated with PCI are summarized in Figure 2.\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n24\nFigure 2.

Clopidogrel is the only currently used P2Y12 inhibitor studied in patients\nwith SIHD undergoing PCI.

In the CURE study (52), the reduction in ischemic events in patients treated with\naspirin plus clopidogrel who underwent CABG was consistent with the study population as a whole, although\nbenefit was primarily observed mainly before the procedure (118). A propensity score analysis of a Danish\nadministrative database (120) demonstrated during a mean follow-up of 466±144 days significantly fewer\ndeaths in patients treated with aspirin plus clopidogrel than in those treated with aspirin alone, although there\nwas no reduction in the incidence of recurrent MI.\nThe impact of clopidogrel on graft occlusion after on-pump CABG has been evaluated in 5 studies\n(Data Supplement 10). Several randomized and nonrandomized trials and a post hoc substudy analysis of\npatients predominantly undergoing on-pump CABG did not demonstrate any differences in graft patency\nbetween antiplatelet monotherapy and DAPT when assessed at follow-up ranging from 1 month to 1 year after\nCABG (131-134). In the only RCT to demonstrate a benefit of DAPT, vein graft patency 3 months after CABG\nwas significantly higher in patients treated with clopidogrel and aspirin (100 mg) than in those receiving aspirin\nmonotherapy (121).\nTwo meta-analyses and 1 systematic overview assessed the potential benefits of DAPT after CABG and\nreported mixed results (122,123,135) (Data Supplement 10). In the largest meta-analysis of patients pooled from\n5 RCTs and 6 observational studies (122), DAPT was associated with reduced vein graft occlusion and 30-day\nmortality rate as compared with aspirin monotherapy. A meta-analysis of only the 5 RCTs (123) showed that\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n26\nDAPT was associated with a significantly lower vein graft occlusion at 1 year versus antiplatelet monotherapy\nbut with no improvement in arterial graft patency. Major bleeding after surgery was more frequent with DAPT\n(122,123,135).\nThe benefits of DAPT in off-pump CABG patients were noted in terms of improved graft patency\n(124,125) and clinical outcome (136) in single-center observational studies (124,136) and an RCT (125) (Data\nSupplement 10).\nOnly data from post hoc analyses are available on the utility of newer P2Y12 inhibitors in patients with\nACS who undergo CABG. In a retrospective analysis of patients in the TRITON-TIMI 38 study (54) who\nunderwent CABG (137), prasugrel treatment was associated with a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate\nthan that of clopidogrel and more postoperative blood loss. A post hoc analysis of patients who underwent\nCABG in the PLATO study (53) showed that the primary endpoint at 1 year was similar for both treatments, but\na significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality was noted with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel\n(138,139).\nIssues related to the timing of discontinuation of DAPT before CABG are beyond the scope of this\nupdate but are addressed in the 2011 CABG guideline (10).

In a post hoc analysis of patients enrolled in the study with prior MI,\na 1.7% absolute decrease in the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke events was observed\nwith DAPT, but no benefit was seen in those with CAD without prior MI (Data Supplement 4) (40,41). In the\nPEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial, in which stable patients 1 to 3 years after MI with additional high-risk features were\nrandomized to either DAPT (with ticagrelor 60 mg or 90 mg twice daily) or continued aspirin monotherapy, a\nmean of 33 months of DAPT led to a 1.2% to 1.3% absolute reduction in ischemic events and a 1.2% to 1.5%\nincrease in major bleeding (28). In subgroup analysis, the greatest reduction in ischemic events was in patients\nin whom P2Y12 inhibitor therapy either had not been discontinued or had been discontinued ≤30 days before\nenrollment in the study (absolute reduction in MACE: 1.9% to 2.5%), and no benefit was seen in patients in\nwhom P2Y12 inhibitor therapy had been discontinued \u003e1 year before enrollment in the study (42).

Duration of DAPT in Patients With ACS Treated With CABG: Recommendation\nSee Online Data Supplement 4 and 11 for evidence supporting this recommendation.\nRecommendation for Duration of DAPT in Patients With ACS Treated With CABG\n7.5. Duration of DAPT in Patients With ACS\nAspirin remains the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy in patients with ACS. Further platelet inhibition, with an\nassociated reduction in ischemic risk, can be achieved by blocking the P2Y12 receptor. In the CURE trial of\npatients with NSTE-ACS, the addition of clopidogrel (for up to 1 year) to aspirin monotherapy resulted in a\n2.1% absolute reduction in subsequent ischemic events but also a 1.0% absolute increase in major bleeding (52).\nThe majority of patients in this study were treated without revascularization, though benefit was observed both\nin those treated with revascularization (PCI or CABG) and in those treated with medical therapy alone (51,52).\nAvailable evidence from this trial, as well as from PLATO (53,71,72) and TRITON-TIMI 38 (54,55), supports\nDAPT duration of at least 12 months for patients with NSTE-ACS.\nCOR LOE Recommendation\nI C-LD\nIn patients with ACS being treated with DAPT who undergo CABG, P2Y12\ninhibitor therapy should be resumed after CABG to complete 12 months of\nDAPT therapy after ACS (52-54,118-120).\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n33\nThe results of the CURE trial (52) and PCI-CURE analyses of the CURE trial (51) (Data Supplement 4)\nhave been extrapolated to patients with STEMI on the basis of the consideration that NSTE-ACS and STEMI\nare both part of the spectrum of ACS and usually caused by coronary plaque rupture. Based on this\nconsideration, as well as the results from the PLATO and TRITON-TIMI 38 trials, it is recommended that\npatients with STEMI treated with coronary stent implantation or medical therapy alone (without\nrevascularization or reperfusion therapy) be treated with DAPT for at least 12 months (53-55,55,71,72).\nTicagrelor is considered a P2Y12 treatment option in patients with STEMI not treated with revascularization (or\nreperfusion therapy) on the basis of a similar extrapolation of the results of the “medically managed” patients\nwith ACS in the PLATO trial (71). On the basis of CURE, PCI-CURE, PLATO, and TRITON-TIMI 38,\nclopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor are all P2Y12 treatment options in patients with ACS treated with PCI.\nIn the CLARITY-TIMI 28 (Clopidogrel as Adjunctive Reperfusion Therapy—Thrombolysis In\nMyocardial Infarction 28) trial, short-term treatment (up to 8 days) with clopidogrel (in addition to aspirin) in\npatients with STEMI undergoing fibrinolytic therapy improved TIMI flow grade in the culprit artery and\ndecreased the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, reinfarction, or the need for urgent revascularization\n(142). In COMMIT (Clopidogrel and Metoprolol in Myocardial Infarction Trial) (93% with STEMI not\nmanaged with primary PCI), treatment for ≈2 weeks with clopidogrel (in addition to aspirin 162 mg) resulted in\na 0.9% absolute reduction of the 28-day composite endpoint of death, reinfarction, or stroke and a 0.6% absolute\nreduction in death (140). A 1.1% absolute risk reduction in the composite endpoint was seen in the subgroup of\npatients who received fibrinolytic therapy. On the basis of these trials and extrapolation of the results of CURE,\nDAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel is recommended for a minimum of 14 days and ideally at least 12 months in\npatients with STEMI treated with fibrinolytic therapy (Data Supplement 4).\nAs discussed in Section 3, treatment with prolonged (extended) DAPT beyond a minimum\nrecommended duration necessitates a fundamental tradeoff between decreasing ischemic risk (e.g., MI and stent\nthrombosis) and increasing bleeding risk (16,24,28,30,34,36,37,46). In post-MI patients, extended DAPT for\napproximately 18 to 36 months leads to an absolute decrease in ischemic complications of ≈1% to 3% and an\nabsolute increase in bleeding complications of ≈1% (Data Supplement 4) (28,40,41,43,44). An analysis from the\nPEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial found that the greatest reduction in ischemic events with prolonged DAPT in post-MI\npatients was in patients in whom P2Y12 inhibitor therapy either had not been discontinued or had been\ndiscontinued for ≤30 days (absolute reduction in MACE: 1.9 % to 2.5%). No benefit was seen in patients in\nwhom P2Y12 inhibitor therapy had been discontinued \u003e1 year before enrollment in the study (42). Decisions\nabout treatment with and duration of DAPT in patients with ACS require a thoughtful assessment of the\nbenefit/risk ratio, integration of study data, and consideration of patient preference.\nIn patients treated with DAPT with high bleeding risk (e.g., oral anticoagulation), increased risk of\nsevere bleeding complications (e.g., major intracranial surgery), or significant overt bleeding, the benefit/risk\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n34\nratio may favor shorter-than-recommended duration of DAPT (17-21,34,36).\nRecommendations for DAPT in patients with ACS treated with medical therapy alone, fibrinolytic\ntherapy, PCI, and CABG are summarized in Figure 5.\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n35\nFigure 5.

DAPT significantly\nreduces the risk of stent thrombosis (50,51,94,95,99), and discontinuation of DAPT in the weeks after stent\nimplantation is one of the strongest risk factors for stent thrombosis, with the magnitude of risk and impact on\nmortality rate inversely proportional to the timing of occurrence after the procedure (145,149,150). Older\nobservational studies found that the risk of stent-related thrombotic complications is highest in the first 4 to 6\nweeks after stent implantation but continues to be elevated at least 1 year after DES placement (101-103,149).\nData from more recent large observational studies suggest that the time frame of increased risk of stent\nthrombosis is on the order of 6 months, irrespective of stent type (BMS or DES) (151-153). In a large cohort of\npatients from the Veterans Health Administration hospitals, the increased risk of surgery for the 6 months after\nstent placement was most pronounced in those patients in whom the indication for PCI was an MI (146). An\nadditional consideration, irrespective of the timing of surgery, is that surgery is associated with proinflammatory\nand prothrombotic effects that may increase the risk of coronary thrombosis at the level of the stented vascular\nsegment as well as throughout the coronary vasculature (154,155).\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n37\nPrior recommendations with regard to duration of DAPT (9,104) and the timing of noncardiac surgery\n(15,156) in patients treated with DES were based on observations of those treated with first-generation DES.\nCompared with first-generation DES, currently used newer-generation DES are associated with a lower risk of\nstent thrombosis and appear to require a shorter minimum duration of DAPT (17,18,21,38,96,97). Several\nstudies of DAPT duration in patients treated with newer-generation DES did not detect any difference in the risk\nof stent thrombosis between patients treated with 3 to 6 months of DAPT or patients treated with longer\ndurations of DAPT (although these studies were underpowered to detect such differences) (17-21) (Data\nSupplement 1). Moreover, the safety of treating selected patients with newer-generation DES for shorter\ndurations (3 or 6 months) of DAPT has been shown in a patient-level analysis pooling 4 trials evaluating DAPT\ndurations (34). Furthermore, in the PARIS (Patterns of Nonadherence to Antiplatelet Regimens in Stented\nPatients) registry, interruption of DAPT according to physician judgment in patients undergoing surgery at any\ntime point after PCI was not associated with an increased risk of MACE (145). On the basis of these\nconsiderations, the prior Class I recommendation that elective noncardiac surgery in patients treated with DES\nbe delayed 1 year (15) has been modified to “optimally at least 6 months.” Similarly, the prior Class IIb\nrecommendation that elective noncardiac surgery in patients treated with DES may be considered after 180 days\n(15) has been modified to “after 3 months.” Figure 6 summarizes recommendations on timing of elective\nnoncardiac surgery in patients with coronary stents.\nThe magnitude of incremental bleeding risk in patients treated with antiplatelet therapy who undergo\nsurgery is uncertain (157,158). If P2Y12 inhibitor therapy needs to be held in patients being treated with DAPT\nafter stent implantation, continuation of aspirin therapy if possible is recommended, though this is based\nprimarily on expert opinion. If a P2Y12 inhibitor has been held before a surgical procedure, therapy is restarted\nas soon as possible, given the substantial thrombotic hazard associated with lack of platelet inhibition early after\nsurgery in patients with recent stent implantation. Although several small studies have used intravenous\nantiplatelet agents as a means of “bridging” in patients requiring temporary discontinuation of DAPT before\nsurgery, there is no convincing clinical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of bridging with either parenteral\nantiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy (159-163).\nDecisions about the timing of surgery and whether to discontinue DAPT after coronary stent\nimplantation are best individualized. Such decisions involve weighing the particular surgical procedure and the\nrisks of delaying the procedure, the risks of ischemia and stent thrombosis, and the risk and consequences of\nbleeding. Given the complexity of these considerations, decisions are best determined by a consensus of the\nsurgeon, anesthesiologist, cardiologist, and patient.\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016\nMANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED\nACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Levine, GN, et al.\nFocused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy\n38\nFigure 6.

A person is deemed to have a significant interest in a business if the interest\nrepresents ownership of ≥5% of the voting stock or share of the business entity, or ownership of ≥$5,000 of the fair market value of the business entity, or if funds\nreceived by the person from the business entity exceed 5% of the person’s gross income for the previous year. A relationship is considered to be modest if it is less than\nsignificant under the preceding definition. Relationships that exist with no financial benefit are also included for the purpose of transparency. Relationships in this table are\nmodest unless otherwise noted. Names are listed in alphabetical order within each category of review.\nAccording to the ACC/AHA, a person has a relevant relationship IF: a) the relationship or interest relates to the same or similar subject matter, intellectual property or\nasset, topic, or issue addressed in the document; or b) the company/entity (with whom the relationship exists) makes a drug, drug class, or device addressed in the\ndocument, or makes a competing drug or device addressed in the document; or c) the person or a member of the person’s household has a reasonable potential for\nfinancial, professional or other personal gain or loss as a result of the issues/content addressed in the document.\n*Significant relationship.\n†No financial benefit.\nAATS indicates American Association for Thoracic Surgery; ACC, American College of Cardiology; ACEP, American College of Emergency Physicians; AHA,\nAmerican Heart Association; CSL, Coordinated Science Laboratory; DSMB, data safety monitoring board; PCNA; Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association; SCA,\nSociety of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologist; SCAI, Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions; STS, Society of Thoracic Surgeons; and SVM, Society for\nVascular Medicine\nSquibb*\n• Eli Lilly/\nDaiichi-Sankyo\nAlliance*\nDownloaded From: http://content.onlinejacc.org/pdfAccess.ashx?url=/data/Journals/JAC/0/ by Henry Tester on 03/29/2016",

These include axial flow pumps, such as Impella®; left atrial to femoral artery bypass pumps, specifically the TandemHeart; and new devices for institution of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. These devices differ significantly in their hemodynamic effects, insertion, monitoring, and clinical applicability. This document reviews the physiologic impact on the circulation of these devices and their use in specific clinical situations. These situations include patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention, those presenting with cardiogenic shock, and acute decompensated heart failure. Specialized uses for right-sided support and in pediatric populations are discussed and the clinical utility of mechanical circulatory support devices is reviewed, as are the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical practice guidelines.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPercutaneous hemodynamic support has historically been limited to the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) or extracorporeal bypass with membrane oxygenator (ECMO) (1–3). Although the IABP is widely available, limitations include modest hemodynamic support or myocardial protection; ECMO can provide full hemodynamic support but is limited by complexity and need for perfusion expertise and is rarely used in the catheterization laboratory environment. These limitations have spurred development of alternative percutaneous mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices with the potential to provide greater cardiac and systemic support and reduce morbidity and mortality among high-risk patient subsets (1).\n\nIn parallel, cardiovascular practice has seen rapid growth in cohorts that may benefit from the use of such devices (4). These include patients with chronic systolic dysfunction and acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), those in whom high-risk multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or other procedures may be required, those with acute cardiogenic shock, and those with residual or concomitant cardiac dysfunction from myocardial infarction despite reperfusion. Among patients with cardiogenic shock, in particular, acute implantation of surgical MCS remains associated with relatively poor outcomes. Accordingly, there has been a rise in the development and use of percutaneous devices over the past decade for both acute (e.g., acute myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by cardiogenic shock or mechanical complications) and acute on chronic (e.g., high risk (HR) PCI) indications.\n\nPercutaneous MCS devices have become an integral component of the cardiovascular therapeutic armamentarium. The 2011 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (ACC/AHA/SCAI) Guideline for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention recommends consideration of percutaneous MCS in two clinical settings: a) as an adjunct to HR PCI (Class IIb) and b) for cardiogenic shock in patients presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (Class Ib) (5). However, no additional guidance is provided. The goal of this document is to provide such guidance on the appropriate clinical settings for MCS utilization and to review the available devices, treatment strategies, practical recommendations for use, gaps in knowledge, and evolving practice.\nClinical Settings and Hemodynamic Substrates\n\nPotential benefits of MCS include the ability to: 1) maintain vital organ perfusion, thereby preventing systemic shock syndrome, 2) reduce intracardiac filling pressures, thereby reducing congestion and/or pulmonary edema, 3) reduce left ventricular volumes, wall stress, and myocardial oxygen consumption, 4) augment coronary perfusion, 5) support the circulation during complex interventional and electrophysiologic procedures, and, theoretically, 6) limit infarct size. As new MCS devices become available, several specific patient populations likely to benefit from this therapy can be identified. These include patients undergoing high-risk PCI (HR-PCI), and those with large acute myocardial infarctions (AMI), acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), and cardiogenic shock.\n\nThe hemodynamic condition of the left ventricle (LV) in these populations is illustrated by the pressure-volume (PV) loop (Figure 1), which provides information about contractile function, relaxation properties, stroke volume, cardiac work, and myocardial oxygen consumption (6–10). The anticipated effect with available support devices is shown in Figure 2. Each clinical syndrome presents a unique set of hemodynamic variables where cardiac function and myocardial oxygen supply or demand is compromised. For example, in AMI, patients may present with reduced LV contractile function, acute diastolic dysfunction, elevated LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and pressure (LVEDP), and increased LV work (oxygen demand) in addition to diminished coronary blood flow. In cardiogenic shock LV contractile function is severely reduced with significantly increased LVEDV and LVEDP, markedly reduced stroke volume, but increased myocardial oxygen demand; coronary blood flow may also be impaired by hypotension and elevated wall stress. These pressure-volume loops provide hemodynamic characterization only of the LV and do not provide information on right ventricular function or extra-cardiac problems that may be impacted by MCS such as systemic hypoperfusion of the cerebral, visceral, renal, and peripheral arteries.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1\n\nNormal and Abnormal Pressure Volume Loops\n\nEach pressure volume (PV) loop represents one cardiac cycle (A). Beginning at the end of isovolumic relaxation (Point 1), LV volume increases during diastole (Phase 1 to 2). At end-diastole (Point 2), LV volume is maximal and isovolumic contraction (Phase 2 to 3) begins. At the peak of isovolume contraction, LV pressure exceeds aortic pressure and blood begins to eject from the LV into the aorta (Point 3). During this systolic ejection phase, LV volume decreases until aortic pressure exceeds LV pressure and the aortic valve closes, which is known as the end-systolic pressure-volume point (ESPV) (Point 4). Stroke volume (SV) is represented by the width of the PV loop as the volume difference between end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes (Points 1 and 2). The shaded area within the loop represents stroke work. Load-independent LV contractility, also known as Emax, is defined as the maximal slope of the ESPV point under various loading conditions, known as the ESPV relationship (ESPVR). Effective arterial elastance (Ea) is a component of LV after- load and is defined as the ratio of end-systolic pressure and stroke volume. Under steady state conditions, optimal LV pump efficiency occurs when the ratio of Ea:Emax approaches 1. (B) Representative PV loop in AMI (blue loop). LV contractility (Emax) is reduced; LV pressure, SV, and LV stroke work may be unchanged or reduced; and LVEDP is increased. (C) Representative PV loop in cardiogenic shock (gray loop). Emax is severely reduced; LVEDV and LVEDP are increased; and SV is reduced.\n\nImage not available.\nView Large  | Download Slide (.ppt) | View in Article Context\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2\n\nCardiac Effects of Mechanical Support\n\nIllustrations of PV loops after activation of device therapy (gray loops).

The net effect is a significant reduction in cardiac workload.

At present, no single, unifying definition for HR-PCI exists but variables that contribute to elevated risk during PCI have been well defined and can be categorized into three major groups: 1) patient specific, 2) lesion specific, and 3) clinical presentation specific.\n\nPatient-specific variables include increased age, impaired left ventricular function, symptoms of heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, prior myocardial infarction, multivessel or left main disease, and peripheral arterial disease (11–18). Lesion-specific variables encompass anatomic characteristics such as left main stenosis, bifurcation disease, saphenous vein grafts, ostial stenoses, heavily calcified lesions, and chronic total occlusions (19–23). Lesions that supply a large territory (including a last patent conduit, left main disease, or critical 3-vessel disease) also increase risk should dissection or occlusion occur during PCI—particularly in combination with poor ventricular function. Finally, the clinical setting, such as acute coronary syndrome or cardiogenic shock, can increase the risk of an adverse event with PCI. The combination of severe left ventricular dysfunction, particularly ADHF, with a lesion(s) that is difficult to treat is an example of HR-PCI.\n\nNeed for an MCS device for HR-PCI depends upon the hemodynamic condition of the patient at the time of PCI, the anticipated risk of hemodynamic compromise during the procedure, and the need for hemodynamic support after revascularization. Risk calculators specifically designed to assess the real-time need for MCS during PCI do not exist and require further investigation.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of non-ST- and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI and STEMI) patients can be safely and effectively treated using standard techniques, selected patients may benefit from the unloading and hemodynamic effects of MCS, which may serve to reduce myocardial oxygen consumption and ischemia, and improve coronary perfusion through effects on coronary blood flow. Due to the presence of active and ongoing myocardial ischemia, NSTEMI and STEMI are among the high-risk clinical scenarios for PCI. Several factors make these patients high risk. Due to myocardial ischemia, left ventricular (LV) diastolic and systolic function is impaired and contributes to elevated in- tracardiac filling pressures. Furthermore, PCI is associated with the risk of thrombotic embolization and infarct extension, which can lead to hemodynamic decompensation. Finally, although standard therapy for STEMI is rapid myocardial reperfusion, up to one-third of STEMI patients do not experience effective reperfusion as assessed by resolution of ST-segment elevation, and reperfusion itself may cause myocardial damage (reperfusion injury) and life- threatening ventricular arrhythmias (24). Whether MCS can reduce myocardial injury in the setting of acute occlusion and subsequent reperfusion for myocardial infarction is unknown.\n\nHeart failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the United States alone, an estimated 5.7 million adults 20 years or older have heart failure, of whom nearly 50% have reduced LV ejection fraction (25).\n\nCardiogenic shock is defined as systemic tissue hypoperfusion secondary to inadequate cardiac output despite adequate circulatory volume and LV filling pressure. Diagnostic hemodynamic criteria include: a systolic blood pressure \u003c90 mm Hg for \u003e30 min; a drop in mean arterial blood pressure \u003e30 mm Hg below baseline, with a cardiac index (CI) \u003c1.8 L/min/m2 without hemodynamic support or \u003c2.2 L/min/m2 with support; and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) \u003e15 mm Hg (26–28).\n\nAmong patients with advanced heart failure, technologic advances have facilitated the use of surgically implanted left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) as a bridge to recovery, bridge to transplant, or for use as permanent (destination) therapy (29). Biventricular assist devices and the total artificial heart are also available as a bridge to transplant for patients with biventricular heart failure. As a result, the use of MCS devices as a treatment strategy for patients presenting with advanced heart failure or cardiogenic shock may be considered. The primary goal of such a strategy is stabilizing a critically ill patient before making a decision regarding durable therapy. Moreover, MCSs may allow for myocardial recovery, possibly obviating the need for destination therapy.\n\nThe optimal timing of MCS insertion in ADHF and cardiogenic shock remains unknown and significant practice variability exists. For patients with advanced HF, the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) has defined seven clinical profiles before implantation of a surgical VAD. Cardiogenic shock is identified by INTERMACS profiles 1 and 2 patients, who either have acutely decompensated or are failing to respond to aggressive inotrope therapy, respectively (30). Both INTERMACS 1 and 2 patients may be considered for temporary MCS support as a bridge to recovery, surgical MCS, or cardiac transplantation.\n\nGiven the growing numbers of patients with compromised cardiac function undergoing percutaneous coronary and valve therapies new applications for this technology are emerging. In the adult population, patients with severe, nonoperable valve disease represent a rapidly growing population; carefully selected patients may benefit from cardiac support during percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement (31,32). Similarly, patients referred for electrophysiologic procedures with severe underling LV dysfunction may not tolerate sustained arrhythmias during prolonged electrophysiological mapping and ablation procedures (33,34). Finally, patients with right ventricular (RV) failure are at considerably higher risk for morbidity and mortality when presenting with AMI, ADHF, or CS. Use of MCS for RV or biventricular support has been reported (35–37) and represents an important new use for this technology. Although not yet available in the United States, a dedicated RV support device is under clinical evaluation (35,38).\n\nMany children have or will develop disorders involving the myocardium. The current therapeutic options for circulatory support in the pediatric population are quite limited. Primary indications for circulatory support in pediatrics include heart failure related to congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, and cardiac allograft failure. The most commonly used method of circulatory support in children is ECMO. According to the most recent Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry Report from January 2013, a total of 6,225 pediatric patients (\u003e31 days to 18 years) have been supported on ECMO since 1990 due to cardiac failure with a 65% survival from ECMO but only a 49% survival to discharge (39). ECMO is able to provide complete circulatory support in a wide range of patients from newborns to adults both with and without congenital heart disease but is highly invasive and survival rates remain low at 40 to 50% (39). At this time, the only percutaneous device approved in the United States for short-term cardiac support in children is the IABP, with all other modalities requiring surgical implantation. MCSs have been utilized for circulatory support in older children successfully in their current configuration (40,41). An important limitation in this patient population is femoral vessel size. Further device iterations may allow broader application.\nAvailable Devices and/or Strategies\n\nThe IABP remains the most commonly used form of circulatory support. The IABP has two major components, a balloon catheter and a pump console to control the balloon. The catheter itself is a double-lumen 7.5–8.0 Fr catheter with a polyethylene balloon attached at its distal end. One lumen is attached to the pump and is used to inflate the balloon with gas. Helium is used because its low viscosity facilitates rapid transfer in and out of the balloon, and because it absorbs very rapidly in blood in the case of balloon rupture. The second lumen of the IABP is used for guidewire insertion and to transduce aortic pressure.\n\nTiming of balloon inflation and deflation is based on electrocardiogram (ECG) or pressure triggers. The balloon inflates with the onset of diastole, which roughly corresponds with electrophysiologic repolarization or the middle of the T-wave on the surface ECG. Following diastole, the balloon rapidly deflates at the onset of LV systole, which is timed to the peak of the R-wave on the surface ECG. Poor ECG quality, electrical interference, and cardiac arrhythmias can result in erratic balloon inflation/deflation and make pumping inadequate or impossible. Excessive tachycardia also mitigates the usefulness for diastolic pressure augmentation, due to a reduction of the time spent in diastole. Modern timing algorithms utilizing fiberoptics can somewhat improve device performance even in the setting of tachycardia or irregular pulse (42), while larger volume balloons (i.e., 50 ml) have recently been developed (43).\n\nThe IABP increases diastolic blood pressure, decreases afterload, decreases myocardial oxygen consumption, increases coronary artery perfusion, and modestly enhances cardiac output. The IABP provides modest ventricular unloading but does increase mean arterial pressure and coronary blood flow. Patients must have some level of left ventricular function and electrical stability for an IABP to be effective, as any increase in cardiac output is dependent on the work of the heart itself. Optimal hemodynamic effect from the IABP is dependent on several factors, including the balloon\u0027s position in the aorta, the blood displacement volume, the balloon diameter in relation to aortic diameter, the timing of balloon inflation in diastole and deflation in systole, and the patient\u0027s own heart rate, blood pressure and vascular resistance (44).\n\nAortic valve regurgitation of greater than a mild degree has traditionally been considered a contraindication to the IABP as diastolic balloon inflation may worsen the degree of regurgitation. Severe peripheral arterial or aortic disease increases the risk of vascular complications such as thromboembolism to the lower extremities or visceral arteries (45).\n\nThe majority of complications from IABP use are vascular and may include stroke (46), limb ischemia, or vascular trauma. Thrombocytopenia from platelet deposition on the IABP membrane (or use of heparin), infection, and complications of immobility can occur in patients who remain on prolonged IABP therapy. Trauma to the aorta or ostia of visceral arteries, including the renal arteries, can occur and result in severe life-threatening complications such as bowel ischemia, atheroembolism, and acute kidney injury.\n\nThere is variability in use of anticoagulation for IABP. Many centers do routinely use anticoagulation, but others do not, particularly with 1:1 pumping. No definitive data exist to provide guidance. Each institution should establish its protocol, with monitoring of bleeding and ischemic complications.\n\nCurrently, only one left atrial—aorta assist device is commercially available, TandemHeart. This is a percutaneously inserted circulatory assist device that pumps blood extracorporeally from the left atrium (LA) to the iliofemoral arterial system via a transseptally placed left atrial cannula, thereby bypassing the LV (47). The TandemHeart has four components: a 21-F transseptal cannula, a centrifugal pump, a femoral arterial cannula, and a control console. Regulatory status includes U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to provide extracorporeal circulatory support for up to 6 h and CE mark for use up to 30 days. It also has FDA approval to add an oxygenator to the circuit allowing for concomitant LV unloading and oxygenation.\n\nThe transseptal cannula is made of wire-reinforced polyurethane with a large end-hole and 14-side holes that allow for aspiration of left atrial blood. The arterial perfusion cannula is available in sizes ranging from 15- to 19-F and is the main determinant of maximal flow. The centrifugal blood pump contains a hydrodynamic bearing that supports a spinning impeller. The pump has a motor chamber and a blood chamber that are separated by a polymeric membrane. The impeller is powered by a brushless DC electromagnetic motor, rotating between 3,000 and 7,500 rpm. The external console controls the pump and provides battery backup in case of power failure. A continuous infusion of heparinized saline flows into the lower chamber of the pump, which provides lubrication and cooling, and prevents thrombus formation.\n\nDuring MCS with TandemHeart, both the LV and the pump contribute flow to the aorta simultaneously (thereby working in parallel, or tandem, rather than in series). The redirection of blood from the LA reduces LV preload, LV workload, filling pressures, wall stress, and myocardial oxygen demand (47,48). The increase in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output supports systemic perfusion. The 19-F arterial cannula allows up to 5 L/min of flow whereas the 15-F cannula will allow up to 3.5 L/min. These values are additive to left ventricular output through the aortic valve, although the contribution of the heart is typically reduced as MCS support is increased due to changes in LV loading conditions (i.e., decrease in preload and increase in afterload). Coronary flow is driven by the perfusion pressure (diastolic pressure—right atrial pressure). With two pumps in parallel, the aorta is perfused and pressured by both LV and the TandemHeart, with the relative contribution of each varying and dependent upon LV response to the pump. Not infrequently LV contraction virtually ceases and perfusion is pump-dependent with a flat mean arterial pressure curve. Ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation usually but not always renders LVADs ineffective due to right ventricular failure (RVF) (49).\n\nAdequate RV function or a concomitant RVAD is usually necessary to maintain left atrial volume. There is limited experience with the use of the TandemHeart device in the setting of a ventricular septal defect or severe aortic regurgitation (50,51). Severe peripheral arterial disease, which is commonly present in elderly patients, may preclude placement of the arterial cannula, or result in peripheral ischemia. In select cases with peripheral arterial disease, a 5- or 6-F sheath can be placed antegrade into the superficial femoral artery and spliced into the arterial outflow cannula to provide limb perfusion. Profound coagulopathies and bleeding diatheses such as heparin induced thrombocytopenia or disseminated intravascular coagulation are contraindications to use of TandemHeart as are the presence of a right or left atrial thrombus. Anticoagulation is important to prevent thromboembolism or in situ thrombosis and few data with anticoagulants other than unfractionated heparin are available although anecdotal reports exist. Activated clotting times about 300 are typically required. Alternative agents such as bivalirudin or argatroban may be required in case of heparin contraindications and their use is empiric.\n\nComplications from the device are similar to other percutaneous support devices and include vascular trauma and limb ischemia (47). Expertise with trans- septal puncture is required, particularly given the caliber of the venous cannula. The relatively low numbers of interventional cardiologists regularly performing transseptal puncture in their practice is an important barrier to clinical application in many labs. Collaboration with colleagues with transseptal experience and imaging guidance using intracardiac or transesophageal echocardiography can facilitate training and safety of the transseptal puncture. Complications unique to transseptal puncture, such as cardiac tamponade can occur; and these risks are increased among anticoagulated patients. Other possible complications include thrombo-or air-embolism and hemolysis. Care must be taken to prevent dislodgement of the left atrial cannula, particularly during patient transport, or if the patient moves their leg, as dislodgement into the right atrium will result in massive right to left shunt and severe systemic desaturation. The cannula may also migrate into a pulmonary vein leading to device malfunction.\n\nThe Impella is a nonpulsatile axial flow Archimedes-screw pump designed to propel blood from the LV into the ascending aorta, in series with the LV (47). Three versions are now available. The 12-F (Impella 2.5) and 21-F (Impella 5.0) devices which provide maximal flow rates of 2.5 and 5.0 L/min, respectively, and a new 14-F device (Impella CP) with an intermediate level of support of 3.0 to 4.0 L/min. These devices are designed to be placed via the femoral artery, either percutaneously (2.5 and CP) or with a surgical cutdown (5.0). Alternate access sites such as the subclavian artery have been described but are not routinely used. The tip of the catheter is a flexible pigtail loop that stabilizes the device in the LV with a low likelihood of perforation. The pigtail connects to a 12-F (2.5 device), 14-F (CP device), or 21-F cannula (5.0 device) that contains the pump inlet and outlet areas, motor housing, and pump pressure monitor. Due to its size, the Impella 5.0 requires a surgical cutdown for deployment via the axillary or femoral artery. A possible advantage of the axillary approach is the potential for long-term support (52).\n\nThe proximal 9-F catheter shaft houses the motor power leads and purge and pressure measurement lumens. The catheter\u0027s proximal end consists of a hub for attachment of a console cable and side arms for attachment of purge solution and pressure-measurement tubing. As the Impella CP device has just recently become available in the United States, the greatest experience to date has been with the Impella 2.5 device.\n\nUnlike the IABP, and comparable to the TandemHeart, the Impella does not require timing, nor is a trigger from an electrocardiographic rhythm or arterial pressure needed. Similar to the TandemHeart, the device allows for stability despite transient arrhythmias, but asystole and ventricular fibrillation are poorly tolerated. The device has received FDA approval for providing up to 6 h of partial circulatory support whereas in Europe, the Impella 2.5 is approved for use of up to 5 days.\n\nThe Impella pumps blood from the LV into the ascending aorta, thereby unloading the LV and increasing forward flow. It reduces myocardial oxygen consumption, improves mean arterial pressure, and reduces pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (53). The Impella 2.5 provides a greater increase in cardiac output than the IABP but less than the TandemHeart device. The more powerful Impella CP and 5.0 devices are comparable to the TandemHeart device in terms of support. Whether the Impella CP further reduces native left ventricular stroke work and wall stress at comparable flow rates to the TandemHeart based on device inflow location is unknown. Similar to the TandemHeart, adequate RV function or concomitant RVAD is necessary to maintain LV preload and hemodynamic support during biventricular failure or unstable ventricular arrhythmias (49).\n\nUse of the Impella is contraindicated in patients with a mechanical aortic valve or left ventricular thrombus. Aortic stenosis and regurgitation are relative contraindications, although reports of use in critical aortic stenosis for hemodynamic rescue or to facilitate valvuloplasty exist (54). The device should not be placed in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease or who cannot tolerate systemic anticoagulation. Theoretically, use of Impella may worsen right-to-left shunting and hypoxemia in patients with a preexisting ventricular septal defect.\n\nThe most commonly reported complications of Impella placement are limb ischemia, vascular injury, and bleeding requiring blood transfusion (55). Vascular complications common to all transfemoral procedures such as hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, and arterial- venous fistula, and retroperitoneal hemorrhage can occur with any mechanical support device.\n\nHemolysis due to mechanical erythrocyte shearing has been reported within the first 24 h of use in 5% to 10% of patients, and may respond to repositioning the device (55). Persistent hemolysis associated with acute kidney injury is an indication for device removal.\n\nECMO provides cardiopulmonary support for patients whose heart and lungs can no longer provide adequate physiologic support. ECMO can be either veno-veno (V-V) for oxygenation only or veno-arterial (V-A) for oxygenation and circulatory support. In cases of biventricular failure, V-A ECMO is the MCS of choice for patients in cardiogenic shock and impaired oxygenation, as it provides full cardiopulmonary support. ECMO may be placed at the bedside without fluoroscopic guidance.\n\nSimilar to a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit used in cardiac surgery, V-A ECMO involves a circuit composed of a centrifugal, nonpulsatile pump for blood propulsion, and a membrane oxygenator for gas exchange. A venous cannula drains deoxygenated blood into a membrane oxygenator for gas exchange, and oxygenated blood is subsequently infused into the patient via an arterial cannula. Anticoagulation is required and unfractionated heparin is the most commonly used agent. The degree of anticoagulation is dependent on the type of membrane oxygenator used, with ACTs ranging between 180 and 250. Venous and arterial cannulae can vary in size but typically will be similar to TandemHeart (20-F venous, 17-F arterial). An experienced cardiac perfusionist is required for management of the ECMO system, whereas they are not required for the other devices.\n\nWhile any standard ECMO or perfusion system available in the hospital may be used, new portable ECMO systems such as CardioHelp (Maquet) have now attained FDA approval and may find a useful role in catheterization laboratories due to the relative ease of implantation and initiation.\n\nV-V ECMO offers gas exchange without hemodynamic support and is useful for conditions associated with severe impairment of gas exchange with stable hemodynamics such as ARDS, or rarely, pulmonary embolism. On the other hand, V-A ECMO provides systemic circulatory support with flows sometimes exceeding 6 L/min depending on cannula sizes. However, due to high myocardial oxygen demand (secondary to high filling pressures and volume), V-A ECMO alone may not significantly reduce ventricular wall stress (56). This has theoretic negative consequences on myocardial protection unless the LV is vented or unloaded by concomitant IABP or Impella (57). Metabolic derangement and deleterious systemic effects of cardiogenic shock can often be corrected within hours of initiation of ECMO.\n\nPerfusionists familiar with device function and maintenance should be readily available. Significant aortic insufficiency may worsen with ECMO and promote increased ventricular wall stress without a venting strategy. Patients with severe peripheral arterial disease should not undergo peripheral cannulation and central cannulation should be considered. Anticoagulation is necessary to prevent thrombosis of the membrane oxygenator and varies dependent upon type. Typical activated clotting times (ACTs) are between 180 and 250. Each laboratory and hospital with a mechanical support program should have target ACTs and regular monitoring as part of its protocol. Alternative antithrombin agents may be required if contraindications to unfractionated heparin exist (58).\n\nComplications of ECMO relate to bleeding and thromboembolic events, as well as hemolysis. Thromboembolic events may occur both in the circuit or the patient if adequate anticoagulation is not achieved. Cannulation complications, common to all large cannulae, may include venous thrombosis or distal arterial ischemia. Similar to TandemHeart, a second, antegrade, arterial sheath inserted into the superficial femoral artery can provide antegrade limb perfusion when needed. Stroke, either embolic or hemorrhagic, can occur and care must be taken to assure adequate but not excessive anticoagulation.\n\nRVF is associated with increased morbidity and mortality (59–67). Management of RVF focuses on reversing the underlying cause, maintaining adequate preload, reducing RV afterload, and enhancing RV contractility. In RVF refractory to medical therapy, options include surgical RVAD implantation, veno-arterial ECMO, cardiac transplantation, or a total artificial heart (67). Historically, percutaneous mechanical support for RVF has been limited to the IABP, which only indirectly benefits RV function by reducing LV afterload and enhancing coronary perfusion. Since RV stroke work requires one-sixth the energy expenditure of the LV (68), pumps that generate continuous flow with a minimal, low-amplitude pulsatile component, may more closely approximate native RV function.\n\nRight ventricular support using two venous cannulas and ECMO or a TandemHeart centrifugal pump providing flow from the right atrium to main pulmonary artery has been reported (69). Since the earliest reports, the TandemHeart RV support device has been implanted for RVF in the setting of AMI (70,71), post-LVAD implant (72), severe pulmonary hypertension (73), and acute cardiac allograft failure (74). Right internal jugular venous cannulation can be used and is particularly useful when the distance from the femoral vein to the fifth intercostal space exceeds 58 cm or if femoral venous access is limited by infection, thrombosis, or an inferior vena caval filter (75). Close monitoring for antegrade cannula migration is essential and may present as hypoxic respiratory failure, hemothorax, hemoptysis, decreased cardiac output, and an acute decrease in device flow. TandemHeart is not FDA-approved for use as an RVAD (36). The Impella RP, a catheter-mounted axial flow pump is undergoing evaluation for management of RVF (38). A potential advantage of the Impella RP device is the need for only a single venous access site. As experience with percutaneous RV support devices grows, their role in the interventional armamentarium of mechanical therapies for heart failure will evolve and will require algorithms for risk stratification, patient and device monitoring, and weaning protocols.\n\nThe primary mechanism of benefit of MCS is to reduce native LV stroke work and myocardial oxygen demand while maintaining systemic and coronary perfusion. Myocardial effects of reducing LV volume and pressure, known as “LV unloading” have been well described (76). Device options can be classified according to pump type and include: volume-displacement pumps (IABP) and continuous-flow pumps, which can be further grouped as axial-flow (Impella) or centrifugal-flow (TandemHeart; CentriMag; Rotaflow) MCSs.\n\nBy displacing blood volume in the descending aorta during systole, the IABP generates a vacuum that is replaced by blood from the LV. The net result is reduced LV afterload, increased stroke volume, and a small reduction in LV stroke work (77). However, the IABP is functionally limited by balloon capacity, accurate timing, and a dependence on native LV function. Whether newer generation, larger capacity IABPs will provide more cardiac support remains unknown.\n\nWith minimal native LV function continuous flow devices actively reduce LV stroke work and myocardial oxygen demand, and can maintain systemic perfusion. Output of these devices is determined by rotor speed and is influenced by preload and afterload. Whether axial or centrifugal flow pumps have different effects on LV unloading has not been clearly established (78,79). Differences between these two device types that impact hemodynamic effects are the rotor sizes and the caliber of the inflow and outflow segments.\n\nTechnical differences between axial and centrifugal devices exist and relate to the location of device inflow and outflow. The Impella is placed across the aortic valve into the LV for direct unloading, while the TandemHeart inflow cannula is placed across the interatrial septum into the LA, thereby reducing LV stroke work indirectly by reducing LV preload. No patient-level data exist currently to suggest that any meaningful difference is observed between unloading via the LA or the LV. In contrast, ECMO, which displaces venous volume into the arterial circulation, can significantly increase after-load on the LV, thereby potentially reducing LV stroke volume, increasing myocardial oxygen demand, and necessitating “venting” of the LV (80). The major technical difference is that to achieve device flow rates of 5 L/min, the TandemHeart device requires venous and arterial cannulation with trans-septal puncture, while the Impella 5.0 pump requires surgical vascular access.\nClinical Data and Guidelines\n\nThe American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Intervention have published expert consensus documents and clinical practice guidelines referencing the use of left ventricular assist devices. The most recent guidelines relating to percutaneous coronary intervention and management of acute coronary syndromes recommend consideration of hemodynamic support devices in the settings of HR-PCI and STEMI with cardiogenic shock and for use in unstable patients being transported from one hospital center to another (5,81).\n\nIn a retrospective study of 48 patients who underwent primary PCI for acute myocardial infarction complicated by cardiogenic shock, those that had an IABP placed before PCI had a lower peak creatine kinase (CK), lower in-hospital mortality and fewer major adverse cardiac events than those with IABP inserted after PCI (82). However, a nonrandomized study examined the use of IABP in HR-PCI using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry database and found no differences in overall mortality and wide regional variation in the use of IABP in this setting (83). Similarly, a meta-analysis of IABP use in AMI found no benefit and potential harm, including a higher risk of stroke (46). Finally, prospective randomized, controlled trials have failed to demonstrate conclusive proof of IABP benefit. The IABP-SHOCK II Trial (84) randomized 600 patients with cardiogenic shock complicating AMI to IABP or no IABP, with all patients expected to undergo early revascularization and to receive optimal medical therapy. The vast majority (83%) of IABP were inserted after the primary PCI procedure; at 30 days, there were 119 deaths (39.7%) in the IABP group and 123 deaths (41.3%) in the control group (p = 0.69), and no significant differences in secondary clinical, laboratory, and resource utilization endpoints. Rates of major bleeding, sepsis, and stroke were also similar between the two groups (84).\n\nDespite limited evidence of meaningful benefit, IABP has received a Class IIa indication for use during STEMI complicated by cardiogenic shock in the 2013 ACCF/AHA guideline statement pertaining to STEMI management (81). IABP use in STEMI without shock was not addressed except to note that it may be useful for mechanical complications of STEMI. Additionally, the current ACCF/AHA guideline statement (5) and the most recent SCAI expert consensus document (85) on PCI without on-site cardiac surgery agree that the ability to provide IABP support during transport of unstable patients is a requirement for such centers.\n\nThe CRISP AMI (Counterpulsation to Reduce Infarct Size Pre-PCI Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial was a 30-center randomized controlled trial that investigated whether routine IABP placement immediately before reperfusion reduced myocardial infarct size in patients presenting with an anterior STEMI. The trial enrolled 337 patients in nine countries. No reduction in infarct size as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was found 3 to 5 days following coronary intervention, and no significant difference in survival was observed at 6-month follow-up between groups (86).\n\nIn a large study from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry, IABP was used in only 10.5% of 181,599 high-risk interventions (defined unprotected left main intervention, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, STEMI and cardiogenic shock) (83). IABP use in this analysis was not associated with lower mortality and varied widely between centers. Since all retrospective nonrandomized studies are subject to significant selection and referral bias it remains unknown what the outcomes of the 18,990 patients would have been had an IABP not been used.\n\nFinally, a prospective randomized clinical trial, BCIS-1, enrolled 301 patients across 17 centers in the UK and failed to show a mortality benefit of routine IABP over provisional IABP use among those referred for HR-PCI (87). On the other hand, routine IABP use significantly reduced major procedural complications (1.3% vs. 10.7%, p \u003c 0.001), particularly procedural hypotension. Procedural hypotension in the group randomized to no IABP necessitated crossing over to IABP in 12% of patients. A long-term follow-up analysis of BCIS-1 out to 51 months showed a 34% relative reduction in all-cause mortality with routine IABP use in patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy undergoing HR-PCI (88).\n\nThe opportunity for these systems to provide greater hemodynamic support than IABP has been demonstrated (89); however, there have been few randomized clinical trials. In an analysis of 117 patients with severe cardiogenic shock refractory to IABP and/or vasopressor therapy, Kar et al. (89) observed significant improvements in cardiac index, systolic blood pressure, and urine output with TandemHeart support over an average implant time of 6 days. In addition, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and serum creatinine levels decreased. Despite these clinical and laboratory improvements, 30-day mortality remained high at 40% with significant bleeding complications. Whether observed mortality would have been higher without circulatory support cannot be determined; however, it bears emphasis that these were the sickest subgroup with true refractory shock with almost one-half undergoing CPR during their course. In a small open-labeled study, Burkhoff et al. (90) randomized 33 patients within 24 h of developing cardiogenic shock to treatment with an IABP or TandemHeart. Compared with IABP, the TandemHeart device resulted in a greater increase in cardiac index and decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, but no difference in severe adverse events or 30-day mortality. Low statistical power due to small numbers precluded definitive conclusions.\n\nSimilar hemodynamic improvements have been demonstrated with the Impella 2.5 system in CS. Seyfarth et al. (91) randomly allocated 25 patients with AMI and cardiogenic shock to receive percutaneous support with an IABP or Impella 2.5 device. Early increases in cardiac index were greater with Impella (+0.49 L/(min m2) vs. +0.11 L/min/m2; p = 0.02). Similar to the TandemHeart data, 30-day mortality was high 46%) and not different between the two groups. Elective use of the Impella 2.5 system has been demonstrated to be safe in HR-PCI (92) although an earlier study raised some concerns about hemolysis and increased left ventricular volume after device activation (93).\n\nA large observational study of the Impella 2.5 device in HR-PCI has been published (94). Most patients were extremely high risk, including inoperable patients with a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease, prior coronary artery bypass grafting, and severe LV dysfunction, as well as a high prevalence of NYHA class III to IV heart failure. Despite these risk factors, procedural success was high with a 90% success rate with multi-vessel revascularization and 8% rate of 30-day major adverse cardiac events. Survival was 91% and 88% at 6 and 12 months, respectively.\n\nThe PROTECT 2 trial is the largest single randomized clinical trial of HR-PCI using MCS ever performed and enrolled 452 symptomatic patients with complex three-vessel disease or unprotected left main coronary artery disease and severely depressed left ventricular function to IABP (n = 226) or Impella 2.5 (n = 226) support for HR PCI (95). The primary end point was a 30-day composite of 11 adverse events and was not significantly different between groups (Impella 35.1% vs. 40.1% IABP, p = 0.227) in the intent-to-treat population. The trial was stopped early for futility. Primary endpoint differences were greater in the per protocol population (34.3% Impella vs. 42.2% IABP, p = 0.092). Impella provided superior hemodynamic support in comparison with IABP, and at 90 days a trend toward decreased events was observed in the intent-to-treat population (40.6% Impella vs. 49.3% IABP, p = 0.066). Differences were magnified in the per protocol population (40.0% Impella vs. 51.0% IABP, p = 0.023) (90). A subsequent analysis redefining myocardial infarction as the development of new Q waves or CKMB more than eight times the upper limit of normal demonstrated lower rates of events in patients treated with Impella (composite event rate 37% vs. 49%, p = 0.014), respectively; and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events 22% vs. 31%, p = 0.034) (96). Interestingly, this is consistent with the late mortality reduction demonstrated in BCIS-1 and has been the cause of intense speculation. The potential mechanism for late benefit may relate to more stable procedural hemodynamics allowing for greater and more complete revascularization, including allowing for more complex PCI procedures such as rotational atherectomy (97).\n\nNo comparable randomized trial of HR-PCI with the TandemHeart device exists. Alli et al. (98) reported a series of 54 patients using the TandemHeart for HR-PCI. All patients were deemed high risk for surgery and underwent complex PCI, with left main and multivessel stenting performed in 64%. Procedural success was high at 97%, and 6-month survival was 87%. Besides demonstrating the safety and feasibility of this device to allow complex intervention in a very high-risk, non-surgical group, hemodynamics improved during support, with a decrease in cardiac filling pressures and increase in cardiac output. No patient required hemodialysis but vascular complications occurred in 13%. Other small series of patients undergoing HR-PCI with TandemHeart support have also been reported (99,100).\n\nIt is important to note that the sickest patients with most significant hemodynamic compromise are clearly not readily enrolled in large clinical trials. Clinical operators frequently empirically use commercially available MCS for hemodynamic support. Exclusion from enrollment of those candidates who would have been the most likely to benefit from enhanced MCS will decrease the power of clinical trials to detect outcome differences.\n\nECMO is part of a broader category termed extracorporeal life support (ECLS) (101). This term includes cardiopulmonary support, extracorporeal CO2 removal, and ECMO. A common cardiac indication for ECMO is in patients with postcardiotomy syndrome and an inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass. ECMO has also been used to support patients with allograft failure following cardiac transplantation, fulminant myocarditis, and severe decompensated heart failure refractory to standard therapies. As a bridge to definitive therapy, ECMO has also been used in patients with cardiogenic shock from acute coronary syndromes and as a bridge to transplant with or without the use of other ventricular assist devices. Multiple reports of ECMO being instituted for cardiac arrest (102,103) exist, and the institution of ECMO for cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest is rapidly growing in popularity (104). A major advantage is the relative ease of implementation, but a disadvantage is the need for specialized perfusion expertise and nursing. Nichol et al. reviewed 84 studies of ECMO instituted for cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest and showed an overall survival of 50% (105).\n\nAnalysis of the ELSO (Extracorporeal Life Support Organization) registry for ECMO used in the setting of adult cardiac arrest demonstrated a 27% survival to hospital discharge with the need for renal replacement therapy increasing odds of mortality (106). A more recent experience similarly found 49% survival with use of either MCS or ECMO in cardiogenic shock, with ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation a risk factor for increased mortality (107). There are no large randomized controlled trials with use of ECMO.\nRecommendations for Use\n\nFor historic reasons, positive inotropes and vasopressors have been first-line therapy for hemodynamic instability and cardiogenic shock. Given the lack of data showing benefit with these agents, and the potential for harm with coronary and peripheral vasoconstriction, MCS may be considered in carefully selected patients with severe hemodynamically unstable cardiovascular presentations. Table 1 lists the most common scenarios in which MCS may be used to provide hemodynamic support and bridge to recovery or definitive therapy. Table 2 provides a guide for clinical use for HR PCI.\n\nTable 1Suggested Indications for Percutaneous MCS\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nTable 2Suggested Schema for Support Device in High-Risk PCI\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nTiming of MCS insertion depends on the indication for use. For cardiogenic shock, a support device should be inserted as soon as possible, particularly if initial attempts with fluid resuscitation and pharmacologic support fail to show any significant hemodynamic benefit, and before PCI (110). Early initiation of MCS support can mitigate the consequences of systemic hypoperfusion, worsening ischemia, and declining cardiac function. Hemodynamic evaluation and monitoring with right heart catheterization is helpful in most cases.\n\nFor prophylactic support during elective, high-risk procedures, the device should be placed before the start of the intervention. If a patient is hemodynamically stable post-procedure, the device can usually be removed immediately. Patients who remain hemodynamically unstable post-procedure or those with cardiogenic shock may remain on percutaneous support until their hemodynamic status improves. Although these devices are labeled for as little as 6 h of use, they have been successfully employed for days or even weeks in selected cases of prolonged shock. A team approach with input from advanced heart failure specialists and VAD/transplant surgeons can facilitate decision making.\n\nMultiple factors must be considered when choosing MCS including: the hemodynamic condition of the patient, hemodynamic impact of the device, technical considerations including ease and rapidity of insertion, and the ultimate goals of support. In emergent situations (e.g. STEMI), IABP is often selected as the quickest and most familiar way to obtain some degree of hemodynamic stabilization, especially in the setting of AMI with pump failure. The initial effects of the IABP on coronary blood flow may be particularly desirable in this setting as well. However, the IABP often requires concomitant pharmacologic support to maintain hemodynamics in those with pump failure, and recent data raise questions about the efficacy and safety of IABP support in this setting (46,86,111,112). Operators familiar with the Impella may elect to insert this device instead in such patients, in order to minimize or obviate pressor use, reduce myocardial oxygen demand and improve systemic perfusion, thereby avoiding systemic shock. In experienced centers, insertion of an Impella 2.5 or CP device may be as rapid as an IABP.\n\nIf hemodynamic compromise occurs despite appropriate medical management and/or IABP, one may consider more powerful hemodynamic support devices such as an axial or centrifugal flow pump. Use of these devices requires an experienced team and may not be possible under all circumstances, particularly with adverse conditions. With experience the Impella 2.5 or CP can be inserted rapidly and provide a higher magnitude of support compared to an IABP. For patients who continue to deteriorate despite such support, TandemHeart using the larger arterial outflow cannula, ECMO, or surgical cutdown for delivery of an Impella 5.0 should be considered.\n\nOperators must consider the advantages and disadvantages of initially selecting a device to achieve higher cardiac output by inserting it at the beginning of a high-risk procedure or at the early stages of ADHF or shock, and perhaps obviating peripheral and coronary vasoconstriction that accompany vasopressor therapy. In patients with cardiogenic shock and mechanical complications, the TandemHeart or Impella 5.0 offers the greatest cardiac output and hemodynamic support while the individual is evaluated for surgery. Inotropes may still be required to support RV function after placement of a left-sided support device. Patients with biventricular failure and/or impaired oxygenation may require ECMO support. Biventricular support with two different devices (e.g., TandemHeart for RV support and Impella or IABP for LV support) has also been reported.\n\nEarly MCS implantation before the patient requires multiple vasopressors is theoretically attractive but requires testing in controlled trials. Insertion of an Impella or TandemHeart device should permit completion of a revascularization procedure without hypotension and systemic hypoperfusion, reduce vasoconstriction more quickly, and achieve a greater likelihood of improved late survival. Such an approach is supported by recent guidelines (5).\n\nGiven the limited prospective, randomized, multicenter data with MCS use, these recommendations must be tempered with understanding of knowledge gaps. The effects of percutaneous MCS on reducing LV stroke work and myocardial oxygen demand in acute myocardial infarction are poorly understood. MCSs may reduce infarct size and/or ischemic complications, but available clinical data so far does not support this indication.\n\nIn patients undergoing HR-PCI, more data are needed on subgroups of patients that may benefit from support (e.g., based on clinical or angiographic characteristics). Likewise, for patients with AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock, the limitations of IABP use are apparent. A phase III, multicenter, three-arm study comparing outcomes with IABP, MCS or neither, with power to determine clinical outcome differences not only in short-term hemodynamics but also long-term survival, is needed. With the re-emergence of ECMO at many centers, the trade-offs between complete cardiopulmonary support versus complexity of intervention and monitoring and potential for complications and impaired myocardial protection need to be defined. On the other hand, partial LV support may offer benefits over current MCS technology in terms of ease of application and patient acceptability.\n\nThe potential advantages of these devices over pharmacologic therapy such as inotropes, with known adverse effects on myocardial oxygen consumption and cardiac rhythm, need to be determined in controlled studies. Finally, more development and clinical data are needed on RV support devices.\n\nThe support devices discussed in this document are expensive, with acquisition, disposable, and operating costs greatly exceeding that of the IABP. Costs incurred during both the initial hospitalization and any subsequent readmissions need to be considered. This is particularly true as most patients are older, have multiple comorbidities, and may experience prolonged hospital length of stays and high readmission rates. A recent European study modeled cost-effectiveness of an Impella in comparison with IABP using decision trees bases upon rates of endpoints reported in the literature. The Impella was associated with an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) between 0.22 (with Euro registry data) and 0.27 (with U.S. registry data). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the device varied between €38,069/$52,063 (with Euroregistry data) and €31,727/$43,390 (with U.S. registry data) per QALY compared with IABP, which is within conventionally accepted parameters of cost effectiveness (113).\n\nA second study utilizing 2010–2011 MedPAR data evaluated the cost-effectiveness of emergency MCS for cardiogenic shock (N = 883) compared with surgical ECMO or VAD therapy (N = 305). MCS was associated with better survival to hospital discharge (56% vs. 42%, p \u003c 0.001), reduced LOS (13.2 and 17.9 days, respectively, p = 0.055) and significantly lower inpatient costs ($90,929 and $144,257, respectively, p \u003c 0.001) (114).\n\nAnother potential use of ventricular support is myocyte preservation during acute ischemic insult (115). Ventricular unloading may reduce myocardial infarct size through enhanced hemodynamics, preserved energetics, and activation of cardioprotective mechanisms (48,116). Despite limited unloading potency, some animal infarct model studies found improved myocyte recovery with IABP use (117,118). However, as described above, the CRISP-AMI study (101) found no difference in mean final infarct size between STEMI patients (not complicated by cardiogenic shock) who received routine IABP compared with those who did not. Animal studies of LV unloading with Impella appeared more favorable (56,119–121) and a preliminary clinical report of Impella for infarct size reduction in the STEMI setting was encouraging (122). The MINI-AMI (Minimizing Infarct Size with Impella 2.5 Following PCI for Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial sought to measure this benefit, but this study was terminated before completion (123). The TandemHeart device will be studied in a trial of similar design entitled TRIS (TandemHeart To Reduce Infarct Size) (Howard C, personal communication). This trial will test the hypothesis that left ventricular unloading before primary PCI will reduce infarct size. No human subject studies of ECMO have been announced to test efficacy in myocardial salvage but portable ECMO devices that have recently become available may have an important role to play in the future.\nConclusions and Summary\n\nThe availability of percutaneous MCS has broadened therapeutic options for patients that require hemodynamic support. A variety of devices are now available, each with specific technical and clinical nuances.\n\nUnfortunately, definitive clinical evidence is in many cases either unavailable or controversial. We provide the following consensus-based summary statements based upon the anticipated hemodynamic effects and risks, clinical outcomes data as well as knowledge gaps.\n\n    1.Percutaneous MCS provides superior hemodynamic support compared to pharmacologic therapy. This is particularly apparent for the Impella and Tandem-Heart devices. These devices should remain available clinically and be appropriately reimbursed.\n    2.Patients in cardiogenic shock represent an extremely high risk group in whom mortality has remained high despite revascularization and pharmacologic therapies. Early placement of an appropriate MCS may be considered in those who fail to stabilize or show signs of improvement quickly after initial interventions.\n    3.MCS may be considered for patients undergoing high-risk PCI, such as those requiring multivessel, left main, or last patent conduit interventions, particularly if the patient is inoperable or has severely decreased ejection fraction or elevated cardiac filling pressures.\n    4.In the setting of profound cardiogenic shock, IABP is less likely to provide benefit than continuous flow pumps including the Impella CP and TandemHeart. ECMO may also provide benefit, particularly for patients with impaired respiratory gas exchange.\n    5.Patients with acute decompensated heart failure may benefit from early use of percutaneous MCS when they continue to deteriorate despite initial interventions. MCS may be considered if patients are candidates for surgically implanted VADs or if rapid recovery is expected (e.g., fulminant myocarditis or stress-induced cardiomyopathy).\n    6.When oxygenation remains impaired, adding an oxygenator to a TandemHeart circuit or use of ECMO should be considered based upon local availability.\n    7.There are insufficient data to support or refute the notion that routine use of MCSs as an adjunct to primary revascularization in the setting of large acute myocardial infarction is useful in reducing reperfusion injury or infarct size. Exploratory studies are underway.\n    8.MCSs may be used for failure to wean off cardiopulmonary bypass, considered as an adjunct to high-risk electrophysiologic procedures when prolonged hypotension is anticipated, or rarely, for valvular interventions.\n    9.Severe biventricular failure may require use of both right- and left-sided percutaneous MCS or veno-arterial ECMO. Certain patients may respond to LVAD implantation with inotropes and/or pulmonary vasodilators to support the right heart. MCS may also be considered for isolated acute RVF complicated by cardiogenic shock.\n    10.Registries and randomized controlled trials comparing different strategies in different clinical scenarios are critically needed.\n    11.Early analyses suggest cost-effectiveness of MCS for emergent use in comparison to surgical ECMO or VAD support, and for elective use in comparison to IABP. Further data are necessary.\n\nReferences\n\n1\nNaidu  S.S.; Novel percutaneous cardiac assist devices: The science of and indications for hemodynamic support.

Dehmer, MD; James C. Blankenship, MD; Mehmet Cilingiroglu, MD; James G. Dwyer, MD; Dmitriy N. Feldman, MD; Timothy J. Gardner, MD; Cindy L. Grines, MD; Mandeep Singh, MD, MPH\n\nJ Am Coll Cardiol. 2014;63(23):2624-2641. doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2014.03.002\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 2007, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) published an Expert Consensus Document titled “The Current Status and Future Direction of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention without On-Site Surgical Backup” (1). This document summarized the available data on the performance of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) without on-site surgery in the United States (US), reviewed the existing literature, examined the recommendations for the performance of PCI in this setting from several professional organizations abroad and from experienced programs in the US, defined the best practices for facilities engaged in PCI without on-site surgery and made recommendations for the future role of PCI without on-site surgery.\n\nSince publication of that document, new studies, meta-analyses, and randomized trials have been published comparing PCI with and without on-site surgery. In addition, the total number of PCIs performed annually has decreased, reports about the overuse of PCI have emerged, and appropriate use criteria for coronary revascularization have been published. A noteworthy change occurred in the 2011 PCI guideline in which elective PCI was upgraded to Class IIb and primary PCI was upgraded to Class IIa at facilities without on-site surgery (2). Several tables on the structure and operation of programs without on-site surgery from the 2007 SCAI Expert Consensus Document were used in the 2011 PCI guideline recommendations. Finally, new updates of the ACCF/SCAI Expert Consensus Document on Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Standards and the ACCF/AHA/SCAI Clinical Competence in Coronary Artery Interventional Procedures have been published (3,4).\n\nAlthough many of the concerns about the safety of PCI without on-site surgery have been resolved, there are new issues to consider as the delivery of PCI continues to evolve in the US. Accordingly, the SCAI, ACCF, and AHA have engaged in this effort to re-evaluate the current status of PCI without on-site surgery in the US. The specific goals of this effort were to:\n\n    1Determine current trends in the prevalence of PCI without on-site surgery in the US;\n    2Summarize new literature related to the performance of PCI without on-site surgery;\n    3Review existing guidelines, expert consensus documents, competency statements and other documents related to PCI without on-site surgery and summarize all relevant information into a single resource document;\n    4Outline the current best practice methods and requirements for facilities engaged in performing PCI without on-site surgery; and\n    5Evaluate the role of PCI without on-site surgery within the current US healthcare system.\n\nAlthough the use of PCI in the US had grown considerably since the early 1980s, data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample cited by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality shows that the annual volume of PCI procedures peaked in 2006 and has since declined by over 30% (5). Numerous factors have contributed to this decline, including a reduction in restenosis by drug-eluting stents, a greater emphasis on medical therapy for the treatment of stable coronary artery disease, enhanced primary and secondary prevention efforts, a reduction in the incidence of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the increasing use of techniques such as fractional flow reserve to better evaluate lesion severity and the development and application of appropriate use criteria (5,6). As a result of these factors, many operators and hospitals now have low-volume practices. Using data from 2008, Maroney et al. estimated that 61% of interventional cardiologists performed 40 or fewer Medicare fee-for-service PCIs annually (7). Clinical data from 1298 facilities reporting to the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) show that 49% of facilities performed ≤400 PCIs and 26% performed ≤200 PCIs annually (Fig. 1) (8). Approximately 33% of facilities had no on-site surgery, and among these, 65% (282 facilities) had an annual case volume of ≤200 PCI procedures.\n\nFigure 1\n\nFigure 1\n\nPCI Volume at Facilities With and Without Cardiac Surgery\n\nImage not available.\nView Large  | Download Slide (.ppt) | View in Article Context\n\nAcross the US, PCI without on-site surgery has increased since 2007. The writing committee assessed the current use of PCI without on-site surgery from a survey of ACC Governors for each state, data from industry sources and direct contact with physicians in various states (Fig. 2). Currently, 45 states allow both primary and elective PCI without on-site surgery, 4 states allow only primary PCI without on-site surgery, and 1 state prohibits PCI without on-site surgery. PCI without on-site surgery is regulated by the State Department of Health in 34 states but is unregulated in the remaining 16 states. Elective PCI without on-site surgery was allowed at selected facilities in 9 states but only as part of statewide demonstration projects or to allow participation in the Cardiovascular Patient Outcomes Research Team (CPORT) Nonprimary PCI (CPORT-E) trial (9). Since the conclusion of CPORT-E, the use of PCI without on-site surgery is being re-evaluated in several of these states. PCI without on-site surgery is currently performed in 19 of the 65 cardiac catheterization laboratories within the Veterans Health Administration (10).\n\nFigure 2\n\nFigure 2\n\nChange in the Availability of PCI Without On-Site Surgery From 2007 to 2013\n\nThe numbers shown indicate the number of states where primary and nonprimary PCI without on-site surgery are allowed.\n\nImage not available.\nView Large  | Download Slide (.ppt) | View in Article Context\n\nSince 2006, 11 original studies and 3 meta-analyses on the topic of PCI without on-site surgery have been identified by a computerized systematic literature search using Medline (PubMed and Ovid) and Cochrane Databases (9,11–23).\n\nSeven studies and 2 meta-analyses of primary PCI showed no difference for in-hospital or 30-day mortality between sites with and without on-site surgery (Table 1). None of the individual studies examining the occurrence of emergency CABG surgery after primary PCI showed a difference between sites with and without on-site surgery. However, 1 meta-analysis showed that sites without on-site surgery had a lower occurrence of emergency CABG surgery after primary PCI (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval 0.35–0.79) (20).\n\nTable 1Studies on Primary PCI Without On-Site Surgery Published Since 2006\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nEight studies examined nonprimary PCI at sites with and without on-site surgery (Table 2). The majority of studies and meta-analyses showed no difference in mortality or a need for emergency CABG at sites without on-site surgery. One study at a high-volume facility performing only elective PCIs and staffed by high-volume interventionalists showed a lower mortality at the facility without on-site surgery (OR, 0.11; 95% CI 0.01–0.79) (21). However, the baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics of the study groups with and without on-site surgery were sufficiently different that a meaningful adjusted analysis could not be performed, and there is therefore the possibility of a case selection bias.\n\nTable 2Studies on Nonprimary PCI Without On-Site Surgery Published Since 2006\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nTwo randomized trials of nonprimary PCI have now been published. The CPORT-E trial randomized over 18,000 patients in a 1:3 ratio to undergo PCI at hospitals with and without on-site cardiac surgery, respectively (9). High-risk patients were excluded, as was the use of atherectomy devices. The trial had 2 primary endpoints: 6-week mortality and 9-month incidence of major adverse cardiac events (composite of death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or target-vessel revascularization). The 6-week mortality rate was 0.9% at hospitals without on-site surgery compared with 1.0% at those with on-site surgery (p = 0.004 for noninferiority). The 9-month rates of major adverse cardiac events were 11.2% and 12.1% at hospitals with and without on-site surgery, respectively (p = 0.05 for noninferiority). A similar, but smaller randomized study of nonemergency PCI was performed in Massachusetts hospitals (11). The rates of major adverse cardiac events were 9.5% in hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery and 9.4% in hospitals with on-site cardiac surgery at 30 days (relative risk, 1.00; 95% one-sided upper confidence limit, 1.22; p \u003c 0.001 for noninferiority) and 17.3% and 17.8%, respectively, at 12 months (relative risk, 0.98; 95% one-sided upper confidence limit, 1.13; p \u003c 0.001 for noninferiority). The individual rates of death, myocardial infarction, repeat revascularization and stroke did not differ significantly between the groups at either time point.\n\nThree meta-analyses conducted primarily with registry data have examined the use of nonprimary PCI at facilities with and without on-site surgery (19,20,23). Overall, the mortality rate and need for emergency CABG surgery did not differ between hospitals with and without on-site surgery. In 1 meta-analysis, after adjusting for publication bias, the mortality rate for nonprimary PCI was 25% higher at centers without on-site surgery compared with centers that had on-site surgery (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.01–1.53; p = 0.04) (20). However, it is important to note that these meta-analyses preceded the publication of the 2 randomized trials (9,11). Therefore, based on these recent studies, there is no indication of increased mortality or a greater need for emergency CABG for either primary or nonprimary PCI at sites without on-site cardiac surgery.\n\nSince 2007, there have been several new documents published that provide guidance for the performance of PCI without on-site surgery. Each new document builds incrementally upon the recommendations from prior documents with slight modifications based on new information. The recommendations for PCI programs without on-site surgery are maturing and becoming uniform over time through the vetting of these recommendations by numerous separate writing committees and undergoing extensive external reviews during document development. Key recommendations for PCI without on-site surgery from those documents are briefly summarized below and have been combined to develop the unified recommendations in this document.\n\nThe 2009 focused update of the ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with STEMI and the ACC/AHA/SCAI guidelines on PCI has been superseded by newer separate guidelines for STEMI and PCI (2,24,25). However, a number of the recommendations from the 2009 document regarding triage and transfer of patients and the development of local STEMI systems have been incorporated into the current document.\n\nCompared with prior guidelines, the 2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention stipulated new classification ratings for both primary and elective PCI at hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery (2). Primary PCI was assigned a Class IIa recommendation (Level of Evidence: B) stating that primary PCI is “reasonable,” provided appropriate planning for program development has been accomplished. Previously, this was assigned a Class IIb recommendation. Elective PCI, previously assigned a Class III recommendation, was given a Class IIb recommendation (Level of Evidence: B) stating it “might be considered in hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery, provided that appropriate planning for program development has been accomplished and rigorous clinical and angiographic criteria are used for proper patient selection”. Elective PCI without on-site cardiac surgical backup was considered appropriate only when performed by experienced operators, with complication rates and outcomes equivalent or superior to national benchmarks. Importantly, the ACCF/AHA/SCAI PCI guidelines state, “desires for personal or institutional financial gain, prestige, market share, or other similar motives are not appropriate considerations for initiation of PCI programs without on-site cardiac surgery.” The guideline assigns a Class III recommendation (Level of Evidence: C) to performing primary or elective PCI in hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery without a proven plan for rapid transport to a cardiac surgery operating room in a nearby hospital and without appropriate hemodynamic support capability for transfers. The 2011 PCI guideline document adapted personnel, facility, operator and structural requirements for PCI without on-site surgery from the 2007 SCAI Expert Consensus document (1). New facility and operator volume requirements were not addressed in the 2011 PCI guidelines but deferred to the 2013 PCI Clinical Competency document (4). In 2011, ACCF/AHA also published a Guideline for Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery that did not discuss the performance of PCI without on-site surgery (26).\n\nSimilar to the 2011 PCI guidelines, this document presented requirements for PCI at facilities without on-site cardiac surgery that were derived from the 2007 SCAI expert consensus document with some modifications (3). This document also presented criteria for excluding patients, based on risk and lesion characteristics, from PCI at facilities without on-site cardiac surgery. The document prescribed the quality assurance/quality improvement (QA/QI) program necessary for all cardiac catheterization laboratories with specific recommendations for structure, process, and outcome variables appropriate for monitoring. Moreover, it recommended that all major complications be reviewed by the QA/QI committee at least every 6 months and that any individual operator with complication rates above benchmarks for 2 consecutive 6-month intervals should have the issue directly addressed by the QA director with a written plan for remediation. The document also recommended that a random sample of cases from all operators should be reviewed at least annually.\n\nIn addition to defining numerous requirements for operator competency, new operator, and facility PCI volume requirements were established (4). Reflecting the overall decline in PCI volumes, this document recommended that laboratories performing both primary and elective PCI, with and without on-site cardiac surgery, should perform a minimum of 200 PCIs annually. Laboratories performing \u003c200 cases annually must have stringent systems and process protocols in place with close monitoring of clinical outcomes and additional strategies that promote adequate operator and catheterization laboratory staff experience through collaborative relationships with larger volume facilities. The existence of laboratories performing \u003c200 PCIs annually that are not serving isolated or underserved populations should be questioned, and any laboratory that cannot maintain satisfactory outcomes should be closed. This recommendation was based on an extensive review of studies that identified a signal suggesting worse outcomes in laboratories performing \u003c200 PCIs annually. The writing committee recommended that operators perform a minimum of 50 PCIs annually (averaged over 2 years), including no less than 11 primary PCIs annually. Ideally, these procedures should be performed in institutions performing \u003e200 total and \u003e36 primary PCI procedures annually. However, it was emphasized that individual operator volume is but one of several factors that should be considered in assessing operator competence, which include lifetime experience, institutional volume, the operator\u0027s other cardiovascular interventions and quality assessment of the operator\u0027s ongoing performance. Operators who cannot maintain these case volume recommendations at their primary practice site should maintain privileges and continue to perform PCI procedures at a high-volume institution with on-site surgical backup to meet annual volume requirements. It was also recommended that operators should be board certified in interventional cardiology and maintain certification, with the exception of operators who have received equivalent training outside the US and are ineligible for board certification in the US.\n\nThis document did not specifically comment on PCI without on-site cardiac surgery but supported the 2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI PCI guidelines recommendations (25). It recommended that primary PCI be performed in high-volume, well-equipped centers with experienced interventional cardiologists, and skilled support staff.\n\nIn contrast to the 2011 ACC/AHA/SCAI PCI guidelines, the 2010 European Society of Cardiology and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines on myocardial revascularization do not comment on PCI without on-site surgery or issues related to institutional or operator competency (27). However, the European guidelines continue to stress the importance of full disclosure regarding the lack of availability of on-site cardiac surgery and the inadvisability of performing PCI for high-risk patients/lesions at facilities that do not have on-site surgical backup.\n\nThe European guidelines for STEMI do not provide specific recommendations regarding PCI at centers without on-site surgery (28). Rather, emphasis is placed on the development of networks between hospitals with differing levels of technology, connected by an efficient emergency transport system. To maximize staff experience, the guidelines recommend that primary PCI centers perform procedures 24 h a day, 7 days a week for all STEMI patients.\n\nOther models mentioned in the European guidelines, although not ideal, include weekly or daily rotation of primary PCI centers or multiple primary PCI centers in the same region. Hospitals that cannot offer a 24/7 service for primary PCI should be allowed to perform primary PCI in patients already admitted for another reason and who develop STEMI during their hospital stay. These hospitals should, however, be discouraged from initiating a service limited to daytime or within-hours primary PCI, because this generates confusion with Emergency Medical Services (EMS) operators and is unlikely to match the door-to-balloon time and quality of intervention of focused 24/7 primary PCI centers. In a survey of European countries, the mean population served by a single primary PCI center varied between 0.3 and 7.4 million inhabitants. In countries offering primary PCI services to the majority of their STEMI patients, this population varied between 0.3 and 1.1 million per center (29). In small service areas, experience can be suboptimal due to an insufficient number of STEMI patients, but the optimal size of a catchment area could not be clearly defined. For geographical areas where the expected transfer time to a primary PCI center makes it impossible to achieve satisfactory reperfusion times, thrombolysis with subsequent immediate transfer to a primary PCI center has been endorsed. Although there is a risk of intracranial bleeding, a potential role for this strategy in selected circumstances has been emphasized (30).\n\nThe 2007 SCAI Expert Consensus Document summarized the recommendations from the British Cardiac Society and British Cardiovascular Intervention Society, the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ), the Spanish Society of Cardiology, the Brazilian Society of Hemodynamics and Interventional Cardiology (Sociedade Brasileira de Hemodinamica e Cardiologia Intervencionista) and from several other countries (31–39). Since 2007, only the guidelines from CSANZ have been updated, most recently in 2011 (32). CSANZ guidelines state that primary PCI without on-site surgery should be performed: (a) by operators and institutions meeting the overall requirements and standards of primary PCI centers; (b) by institutions with a proven plan for rapid transport to a cardiac surgical center; (c) in a timely fashion (\u003c90 min); and (d) using rigorous case selection criteria. The CSANZ guidelines acknowledged that rural patients might have limited access to diagnostic angiography and PCI, and providing these services at institutions without on-site surgery by appropriately trained individuals facilitates equity of access, which should result in improved quality of care. However, the CSANZ guidelines also specifically state that rural and regional centers should not perform elective, high-risk PCI procedures if they are located more than 1 hour travel time from cardiac surgery centers.\n\nIn March 2012, the AHA issued a policy statement on PCI without surgical backup defining two major reasons for providing PCI without on-site surgery (40). First, PCI without on-site surgery is considered reasonable if the intent is to provide high quality timely primary PCI for patients with STEMI. The statement recommended that each community and facility in the community have an agreed-upon plan for how STEMI patients are to be treated. The plan should indicate hospitals that should receive STEMI patients from EMS units capable of obtaining diagnostic electrocardiograms, the management at the initial receiving hospital and written criteria and agreements for the expeditious transfer of patients from nonPCI-capable to PCI-capable facilities. Second, PCI without on-site surgery is a reasonable consideration for providing local care to patients and families who do not want to travel significant distances or who have certain preferred local physicians. This is an important consideration, but the policy statement emphasized that evolving evidence suggests that such centers should have mechanisms in place to ensure high quality care. In addition to emphasizing the current guideline classifications for PCI without on-site surgery, the AHA policy statement provided recommendations for states wishing to address the issue of PCI without on-site surgery through the regulation of legislation.\n\nThe Mission Lifeline program developed in 2006 from a series of conferences sponsored by the AHA and has continued to mature (41–43). The goal of Mission Lifeline is to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with STEMI and to improve healthcare system readiness and response to STEMI. An important focus of Mission Lifeline is to increase the number of patients with timely access to primary PCI. Criteria for the structure and operation of a STEMI referral and STEMI-receiving hospitals are part of the Mission Lifeline initiative and apply to facilities without on-site surgery.\n\nThe Door-to-Balloon (D2B™) effort began in January 2006 when the ACC recognized the need to reduce D2B times for patients with STEMI. This led to the development of a national initiative to achieve D2B times ≤90 min for at least 75% of nontransfer primary PCI patients with STEMI in participating hospitals performing primary PCI. This alliance consists of a nationwide network of hospitals, physician champions and strategic partners committed to improving D2B times. Participation in the Alliance provides the necessary tools; information and support for helping hospitals achieve the D2B treatment goals and encourages the use of real-time performance feedback on D2B times to drive the quality improvement effort (44). The D2B program has been highly successful, having achieved its initial goals (45).\n\nData from the American Hospital Association and the 2000 US Census were used to estimate the proportion of the adult population (≥18 years of age) who lived within 60 min of a PCI hospital (46). An estimated 79.0% lived within a 1 hour drive of a PCI hospital, with a median driving time of 11.3 min. Even among those living closer to non-PCI hospitals, 74% would experience \u003c30 min of additional delay with a direct referral to a PCI hospital. Approximately 5 years later, Concannon et al., using similar data sources and methodology, showed that despite a 44% relative increase in the number of facilities capable of performing PCI, the number of adults within a 1 hour drive of a PCI facility increased to only 79.9%, with the median driving time reduced by \u003c1 min to 10.5 min (47). Access in rural areas remained far less than in urban areas, with driving times reduced for only 9% of the population compared with the earlier survey. These findings mirrored a smaller experience in Michigan where expansion of primary PCI to 12 hospitals without on-site surgery increased access for only 4.8% of the population (48). Finally, Horwitz et al. showed that hospitals are more likely to introduce new invasive cardiac services when neighboring hospitals already offer such services and confirmed that the increase in the number of hospitals offering invasive cardiac services has not led to a corresponding increase in geographic access (49). In total, these data support the argument that the addition of more PCI centers has not substantially improved access to PCI services for most patients.\n\nMedicare payments to hospitals for invasive cardiac procedures have generally remained favorable, although physician reimbursement has decreased. Per-case revenue margins for PCI are typically higher than the overall hospital operating margins, and PCI improves the hospital case mix index. PCI programs bring prestige to an institution, and STEMI is one of the most prestigious diseases for treatment (50,51). The push to develop rapid STEMI care has led many to currently advocate for EMS bypassing non-PCI hospitals; there is even consideration being given to triaging patients based on D2B metrics. Exclusion from providing STEMI care might be a lesser financial concern than the loss of downstream revenue from additional testing in patients suspected of having an acute coronary syndrome. This includes not only testing performed to exclude CAD as the cause of chest pain but also testing to evaluate noncardiac causes of chest pain. This can be an additional financial motivator for developing PCI facilities (52). How the further bundling of payments and reimbursements on a global or capitated basis by accountable care organizations (ACO) will affect PCI programs is unclear at this time, but given the concerns about the cost of healthcare, increases in payments are unlikely (53,54). However, even in an ACO environment, hospitals might benefit from keeping cardiovascular procedures in-house where they have the ability to control costs rather than transferring patients to tertiary hospitals.\n\nThere are 26 states with Certificate of Need (CON) regulations for the development of cardiac catheterization laboratories, but the effect of such regulations is uncertain. Ho et al. found that the removal of state cardiac CON regulations was associated with an increase in the number of hospitals performing CABG and PCI, but the statewide number of procedures was unchanged. The average procedure volume per hospital for both CABG and PCI therefore declined (55). Despite this, they found no evidence that CON regulations lowered procedural mortality rates for CABG or PCI. In other studies, CON regulation of cardiac catheterization was associated with care that was judged more appropriate, whereas the removal of CON regulation of cardiac surgery has been associated with an increase in low-volume cardiac surgical centers and increased mortality (56,57). Concerns have been raised that the proliferation of small centers performing complex procedures that have a small but definite risk of important complications might dilute the ability to provide efficient high quality service (52,58). Reduced mortality has been associated with an increased volume of primary PCI procedures in centers, higher volume operators, total volume of PCIs in centers, and the commitment of a center to provide PCI rather than fibrinolytic therapy (59–63). Lieu et al. reported that redundant or low-volume primary PCI programs were cost ineffective (64). Elective PCI at centers without on-site surgery was more expensive than PCI at centers with on-site surgery in one case-matched study (65). In addition, the high fixed costs of a cardiac surgery program in the face of decreasing surgical volumes is leading to the consolidation of numerous smaller surgery programs, depriving some PCI programs of surgical backup.\n\nThe issue of a PCI volume-outcome relationship was extensively reviewed in the 2013 PCI Competency document for centers with and without on-site surgery and for primary and elective PCI (4). The document concluded that in the current era, volume-outcome relationships are not as robust as in the past when balloon angioplasty was the only treatment modality. However, an institutional volume threshold of \u003c200 PCIs annually appeared to be consistently associated with worse outcomes. Primary PCI volume ≤ the guideline-recommended minimum of 36 annually was associated with worse in-hospital mortality in a recent series of over 86,000 patients in the NCDR (66). The cutoff points of \u003c200 total PCIs annually and ≤36 primary PCIs annually has important implications because 26% of the PCI facilities submitting data to the NCDR performed ≤200 total PCIs annually and 38% performed ≤36 primary PCIs annually (8,66). Recent data suggested a modest volume-outcome relationship for variables other than mortality, but these data have limitations and are not consistent across all studies (4). Although there was an association between annual PCI volumes \u003c200 and worse outcomes, there was no association between higher annual hospital volumes and improved outcomes at higher volume PCI centers. There was less evidence to support a threshold for individual operator volume for both elective and primary PCI.\n\nWe have provided recommendations for PCI without on-site surgery that are a composite of recommendations from the 2007 SCAI Expert Consensus Statement, the 2011 PCI guidelines, the 2012 Expert Consensus Document on Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Standards, the 2013 PCI Competency statement and recommendations from the policy statement of the American Heart Association and requirements for the Mission Lifeline program and D2B Alliance (1–4,40,43,44). Redundant recommendations from these documents were consolidated, and the writing committee included several new recommendations consistent with evolving practice standards.\n\nFacility requirements are similar to those presented in past documents but now include a greater emphasis on the presence of quality review programs for facilities and operators, as described in the 2013 PCI competency document (4) (Table 3). Diagnostic modalities such as IVUS and especially fractional flow reserve previously considered desirable for facilities without on-site surgery have now increased in importance and are necessary for all PCI centers.\n\nTable 3Facility Requirements for PCI Programs Without On-Site Surgery\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nThe 2013 PCI Competency Document identified a signal suggesting that an institutional volume threshold of \u003c200 PCIs/year was associated with worse outcomes. Therefore, the 2013 Competency Document recommended that the continued operation of laboratories performing \u003c200 procedures annually that are not serving isolated or underserved populations be questioned and that any laboratory that cannot maintain satisfactory outcomes should be closed. Past documents have not specified any criteria for geographic isolation. The writing committee suggests it be defined not by distance but by the time required for emergency transport of a STEMI patient to another facility. Hospitals justify the creation of new PCI centers without on-site surgery by stating that they improve access for geographically under-served populations and allow patients to be cared for in close geographic proximity to their own families and physicians. However, multiple low-volume and partial-service PCI centers within a geographic area diffuse PCI expertise, increase costs for the overall health system and have not been shown to improve access (46–49). If the transfer time is ≤30 min, it is reasonable to assume that transfer to the nearest PCI center will provide reperfusion as rapidly as if it were available at the first hospital. For transport times longer than 30 min, performing PCI on-site is likely to be quicker than a transfer. The development of PCI facilities within a 30-min emergency transfer time to an established facility is therefore strongly discouraged.\n\nWhat constitutes a reasonable transport time for a patient requiring emergency surgery has not been consistently addressed in prior documents. Both CPORT-E and MASS-COMM studies provide guidance contained in their on-line supplementary materials (9,11). Both require a transport vehicle to be available to begin transport within 30 min and arrival at the surgical hospital within 60 min of the decision to declare the need for emergency surgery. MASS-COMM further recommends that surgical intervention begin within 120 min. Given the existing data on the distribution of PCI facilities in the US, the performance of elective PCI at facilities that cannot meet these transfer times is discouraged (46,47).\n\nThe 2013 PCI competency document also states that any laboratory that cannot maintain satisfactory outcomes should be closed; however, there is currently no national definition for “satisfactory outcomes”. The writing committee recommends that these be defined by each PCI center, including those with on-site surgery, as part of their quality review process, using national benchmark data. Programs failing to meet established criteria for satisfactory performance for two consecutive quarters must undertake efforts to improve their performance, engaging outside experts if necessary. Failure to improve quality metrics should lead to program closure regardless of the location. To ensure proper assessment and monitoring, laboratories are required to submit data to a national data registry, have regular meetings to discuss key performance metrics and develop plans for the correction of any deficiencies. Especially with facility PCI volumes decreasing, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine whether there are significant differences in the data reports from year to year. For example, to detect (with statistical certainty) a doubling of in-hospital mortality from 1% to 2% at a hospital with an annual case volume of 200 PCIs, nearly 4 years of continuous data collection would be required. This does not negate the importance of data submission to a national registry that can help identify trends, but it emphasizes why these same data must be carefully evaluated and adjudicated at the local facility. The importance of unbiased local or external peer review cannot be overemphasized (67,68). Implementation of the SCAI Quality Toolkit and certification by Accreditation for Cardiovascular Excellence (ACE) are recommended as resources for improving quality (69,70).\n\nRecognizing the potential for isolation and the advantage of clinical experience, the 2007 SCAI Expert Consensus Document included a recommendation that operators at PCI programs without on-site surgery perform at least 100 total and 18 primary PCIs annually, a recommendation that might not be achievable in the current environment. The 2013 PCI Competency Document moves away from strict volume requirements to focus more on achieving quality metrics for facilities and individual operators. As noted earlier, the 2013 Competency document recommended that operators perform a minimum of 50 PCIs annually (averaged over 2 years), including no less than 11 primary PCIs annually. Ideally, these procedures should be performed in institutions performing \u003e200 total and \u003e36 primary PCI procedures annually (Table 4). Again acknowledging the importance of experience, the 2007 SCAI Expert Consensus Document suggested that initial operators at a new program without on-site surgery should have a lifetime experience of \u003e500 PCIs as primary operator after completing a fellowship. In the current environment of decreasing PCI volumes and in view of the recommendations of the 2013 PCI competence document, this number would be difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it is unwise for a newly trained interventional cardiologist to start a new PCI program. Newly trained interventional cardiologists joining an established PCI program should be mentored by more experienced physicians until it is determined that the skills, judgment and outcomes of these new cardiologists are acceptable.\n\nTable 4Personnel Requirements for PCI Programs Without On-Site Surgery\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nRecommendations for the interactions between cardiologists and cardiac surgeons are listed in Table 5. A limitation of programs performing PCI without on-site surgery is the lack of on-site access to a cardiac surgeon for consultation about revascularization options. This makes the concept of a Heart Team consultation more difficult to achieve and could necessitate performing only diagnostic catheterization until a case review with a cardiac surgeon can be performed. The application of telemedicine consultations with a heart surgeon could facilitate these interactions. In reality, many of the nonemergency patients who merit discussion by a Heart Team are not optimal candidates for PCI at facilities without on-site cardiac surgery. It is important to emphasize that the role of the cardiac surgeon is not confined to the treatment of PCI complications but includes the participation in decisions about revascularization options. Recommendations for case selection at facilities without on-site surgery are shown in Table 5, and criteria for identifying high-risk lesions and patients are contained in Table 6. There are statistical models for identifying PCI patients at higher risk for mortality or emergency CABG that could be helpful for identifying patients who should not undergo PCI at facilities without on-site surgery (18,71). However, these models have not been tested or applied on a large scale to determine the advisability of performing a PCI at facilities without on-site surgery.\n\nTable 5Recommendations for Off-Site Surgical Backup and Case Selection\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nTable 6Patient and Lesion Characteristics That Could Be Unsuitable for Nonemergency Procedures at Facilities Without On-Site Cardiac Surgery\nView Large | Save Table  | Download Slide (.ppt)\n\nAs a result of the additional randomized studies on PCI without on-site surgery and the recent change in guideline recommendations, the performance of PCI without on-site surgery in the US has gained greater acceptance, and questions about its safety in the presence of a proven, well defined, and protocol driven approach have diminished. PCI programs should be evaluated based on their ability to: (a) sustain adequate quality metrics, (b) provide access to elective and emergency PCI procedures that would otherwise be unavailable in their service area, and (c) maintain the operator and institutional volumes recommended in the 2013 PCI Competency Document. For the future, the focus must now shift to developing a rational plan for the distribution of PCI services. Small PCI programs with large fixed costs are inefficient and unnecessary if they do not improve access in areas of need. However, it is unlikely that issues of system-wide efficiency will be addressed without central planning on the state or federal level. This writing group reaffirms the statement from the 2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI PCI Guidelines that “desires for personal or institutional financial gain, prestige, market share, or other similar motives are not appropriate considerations for initiation of PCI programs without on-site cardiac surgery” and suggests that new programs offering PCI without on-site surgery are inappropriate unless they clearly serve geographically isolated populations. The writing group recognizes the need for ongoing study and surveillance of all PCI programs through participation in national databases encourages public reporting of their results and acknowledges that further declines in PCI volumes might necessitate the closure of PCI programs in the future.\nReferences\n\n1\nDehmer  G.J., Blankenship  J., Wharton  T.P.
